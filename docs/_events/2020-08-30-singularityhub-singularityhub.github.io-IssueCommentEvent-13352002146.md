<small>I have seen changed behavior - it used to be that you could copy files from the host to /tmp, and have it work. I was testing old recipes from a few years back and the files were no longer found there, so I wonder if that could have been the issue. It also seems to be that the host's software is not accessible to the build, which makes sense because it could have escalated privileged and do something on the host....</small>
