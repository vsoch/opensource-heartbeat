<small>What a puzzle! And such persistence! I'm so happy that you figured it out! I will make sure to note next time where I'm running things - I was using data/container/code in my scratch space, and using the sample data that you provided to me from Google Drive. I incorrectly made the assumption that all datasets were equivalent. Anyway, woohoo! And happy Friday!...</small>
