<small>@adeepak7 adding your blog would be a wonderful addition, but I think we should aim to focus on content that is strongly rseng related. For my blog, what I do is create a custom feed based on a tag, "rseng" and I think it would be good to do that here. It looks like for medium you can create a feed for "tagged pages in publications," see here https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214874118-Using-RSS-feeds-of-profiles-and-publications. And if you are up to it, you could set up a GitHub based blog (using GitHub pages) that could easily generate the feed. For the first, please feel free to leave the PR open until you have the feed, and for the latter, please ping me on any GitHub issues where I might help out. ...</small>
