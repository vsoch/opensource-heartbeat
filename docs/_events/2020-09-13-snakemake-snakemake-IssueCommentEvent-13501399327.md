<small>Thanks for pinging me @dcroote ! I don't get notifications for all snakemake issues, so I didn't know about this. Please ping me right away next time there is any issue with the gls executor! Here is a PR to test for the current issue https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/pull/618....</small>
