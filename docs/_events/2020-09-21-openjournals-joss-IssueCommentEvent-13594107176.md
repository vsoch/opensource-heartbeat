<small>hey @emdupre ! We didn't wind up working on this because @arfon had too many pots in the fire (is that how they say that?) - but if a development version is something you'd be interested in, I'd be happy to try and help again (it's been a while and I don't remember the specifics of the deployment). I do think we'd probably need your help with questions that might come up, is that something you'd have time for @arfon? ...</small>
