<small>I think I'm wondering about the methods that folks generally use to schedule / plan, and if that warrants having a calendar that works really well, period. For example, I'm not likely to browse to an event page and click "Add to calendar" but I am likely to register for things, and then get a Zoom email invite that I add to my calendar. I'm also likely to do the same route, but through slack. So TLDR: if there was a huge need for a nicer calendar, we'd probably want to jump on it. But I think the most common use case is the "Add to Calendar" via a Zoom invite, so I'm erring on the side of not needing a nicer one....</small>
