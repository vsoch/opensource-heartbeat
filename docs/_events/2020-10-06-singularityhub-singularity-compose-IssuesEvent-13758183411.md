<p>Instance control broken with 3.6.0</p><small>I'm not sure when this happened, but instance control with singularity-compose seems broken with 3.6.0 - likely Sylabs changed their API and didn't post an issue here. Since it still works fine for older versions of singularity I'm going to leave as is for now, and can address if anyone actually uses this tool and requests the change....</small><a href='https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-compose/issues/37' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
