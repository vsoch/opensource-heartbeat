<small>hey @CowanCS1 I just wanted to let you know that I hear you! There is one thing I want to try that might allow for a folder, and I'll try to make some time this weekend. I can't make promises because Google Storage isn't really designed to have "folders" (a folder is just part of the path to a file in an object store) but I at least want to test something out. I'll let you know if it gets anywhere. In the meantime, could you provide a simple Snakefile that reproduces your particular issue? That will be very helpful for me to test....</small>
