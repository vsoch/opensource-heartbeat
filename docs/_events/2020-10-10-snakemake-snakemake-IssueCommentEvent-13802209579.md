<small>hey @CowanCS1! So it looks like you are copying the code that the worker runs for the step (downloading gls.py) can you provide a basic example of generating some number of files with a directory prefix for the output that fails? We need to work on one thing at a time, and there are many moving pieces in the Snakefile above....</small>
