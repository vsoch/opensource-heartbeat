<small>hey @lmcdasm another update for you - the initial (conformance testing passing) version of django-oci (a plugin to implement oci in a registry) is ready! https://vsoch.github.io/django-oci/ There are many things to add (interface views for an example app, authentication, different storage backends), but if you want to take a look and express what is important to you / otherwise give feedback it would be appreciated!...</small>
