<small>GitHub Actions set-env deprecation

Announced on October 1st, [set-env is being deprecated](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-github-actions-deprecating-set-env-and-add-path-commands/) and we've started to see warnings in various workflow runs that use it. I noticed you use it here, and wanted to offer a quick fix.</small>
