<small>The commit is now represented in the same PR branch, so the easiest thing is to do the exact same set of steps as before. If you want to update the current combined branch that you put together (harder) then you'd want to pull again from the PR branch to grab the commit. You can use git log to peek and see what commits you've added, and of course visually check the code for a sanity check....</small>
