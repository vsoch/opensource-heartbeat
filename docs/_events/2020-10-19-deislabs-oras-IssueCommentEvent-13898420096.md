<small>In case it's helpful, I just finished a first draft of a distribution spec Python client, "Reggie Python" in the [opencontainers](https://vsoch.github.io/oci-python/docs/getting-started#distribution-specification) distribution module to mirror the GoLang counterpart, [Reggie](https://github.com/bloodorangeio/reggie) inspired by @jdolitsky. Has anyone started working on ORAS-python, or need help? I really enjoy this stuffs so I can offer to help, but I'd probably need pointers since I'm familiar with the distribution spec but not oras specifically. ...</small>
