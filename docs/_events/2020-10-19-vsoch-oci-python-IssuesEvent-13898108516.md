<p>[distrubution-spec] Add custom transport adapter to client</p><small>I want to check on what are the reasons/ advantages to creating a custom transport adapter, as is done [here](https://github.com/bloodorangeio/reggie/blob/cbf8a5144f01140cefe6c9d997fc24994682efe7/client.go#L155). The python requests library allows for definition of a similar thing: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/advanced/#transport-adapters. @jdolitsky sorry for the multiple pokes today! If you have a few minutes in the next week or so to give a quick answer, it will definitely be helpful! For the meantime I'm going to skip creating the custom adapter....</small><a href='https://github.com/vsoch/oci-python/issues/10' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
