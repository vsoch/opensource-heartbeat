<p>check_badge should not system exit</p><small>If a user wants to use this library programatically, e.g., run over many repositories, it would be ideal for the check_badge function to not sys.exit(0), but instead to return True or False. For the case of the client, the sys.exit would go after this function call. I can put in a pull request with this suggested change if you think it's a good idea!...</small><a href='https://github.com/fair-software/howfairis/issues/47' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
