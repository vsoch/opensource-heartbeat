<small>hey @MrD2 ! This looks like an issue with Singularity not being compliant for the OCI distribution spec, and this is indeed true. The repository here is no longer maintained - it's the old documentation site for Singularity containers, which eventually was ported to the sylabs organization, and then hpcng. You should likely close the issue here and open it up at https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/issues. I too would very much like to see the singularity command line client be OCI compliant for a registry, but it's likely a tough push because the company that runs Singularity has their own proprietary "library" client and server, and having OCI compliance would then make it easy to push to any registry and thus lose customers....</small>
