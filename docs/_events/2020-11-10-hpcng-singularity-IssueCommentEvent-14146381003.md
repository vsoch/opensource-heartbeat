<small>Singularity Python does it's best to map between the two, but it's not a promise of perfection, only a means to get started. For `WORKDIR` we already try to capture it as much as we can, without singularity supporting WORKDIR. Both to [account for the runscript being in a working directory](https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-cli/blob/master/spython/main/parse/writers/singularity.py#L82) and for changes during build https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-cli/blob/master/spython/main/parse/parsers/docker.py#L418....</small>
