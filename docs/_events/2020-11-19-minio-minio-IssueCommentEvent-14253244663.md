<small>@harshavardhana yeah, this is what I suspected. I think what I'll try is implementing the PUT/POST option (and disabling chunked with PATCH). I likely won't get back to working on this for a bit, and you've answered my question, so please feel free to close the issue, unless you think it would be beneficial for others to possibly see and weigh in on....</small>
