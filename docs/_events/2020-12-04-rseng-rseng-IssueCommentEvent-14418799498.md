<small>Ah, thanks for pointing this out! The pages are now hosted on `gh-pages` so "master" just needs to be changed to "gh-pages", e.g., https://github.com/rseng/rseng/blob/gh-pages/_criteria/RSE-absence.md. Do you have bandwidth to do a PR - the file is here -> https://github.com/rseng/rseng/blob/gh-pages/_includes/appheader.html#L15. Let me know if you do or not, I can definitely also quickly make the change. ...</small>
