<p>Style of box</p><small>Thank you for creating this library, it's really useful! We have a page that uses tagify, and the search box (an input) is eventually changed to a `<tags><span></span></tags>` sort of setup. The issue is that the style on the page, to the viewer, seems to "jump" from an unstyled to the styled box. Is there any way / suggestion to style the original input so the change isn't noticeable? ...</small><a href='https://github.com/yairEO/tagify/issues/708' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
