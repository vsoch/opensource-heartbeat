<p>conformance for django-oci</p><small>Hey there! Django-oci is a bit different than the registries I see here in that it's not an official service, it's something that a user can implement as a plugin in their own Django app. That said, I do run the complete conformance testing suite: https://vsoch.github.io/django-oci/conformance/. Is there a way that we can include it here? Maybe a different kind of group that is for plugins and similar that implement the OCI distribution spec?...</small><a href='https://github.com/opencontainers/oci-conformance/issues/63' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
