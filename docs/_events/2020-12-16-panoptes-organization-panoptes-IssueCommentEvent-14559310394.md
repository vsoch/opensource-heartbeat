<small>I've heard of FastAPI and have seen how it can be used alongside, but my preference is for using fewer dependencies, and also more stable (less new) things, so I haven't had the incentive to use it. I would want to see evidence that a Flask or Django API is not sufficiently fast for a use case before deciding it's needed....</small>
