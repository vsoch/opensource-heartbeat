<small>Okay I tried to debug this - I'm not able to get far enough into the execution to look closely at anything. @johanneskoester is there an AWS account for snakemake that I am allowed to use? In the meantime, @gdeoli our only option is probably for me to put something together to test, and then for you to test! Here is a PR to do that - https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/pull/816....</small>
