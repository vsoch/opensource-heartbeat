<small>hey @cosmicexplorer ! We had really good discussion on slack, and I think this issue would be a first good one to start helping with. So before we get holiday-ed away, I want to see how I can start helping here. The goal of this PR seems fairly straight forward - to give users more freedom to specify ranges of versions with a new syntax, and it looks like it needs a rebase to fix conflicts (I don't have write access so I cannot) but after that, what specific bullet / thing could I look at first?...</small>
