<small>if it's truly the same issue as with GLS, then we need someone that develops snakemake and familiar with Tibanna to do the same thing for S3 as we did for Google Storage, this PR https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/pull/691/files. I don't think I can help much further without being able to explicitly test - the PR I made was done blindly....</small>
