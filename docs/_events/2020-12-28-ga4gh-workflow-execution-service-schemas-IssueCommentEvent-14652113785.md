<small>And for authentication, I'm used to a server returning 401 with a Www-Authenticate header to request authentication. Is that something supported here? I saw the `auth_instructions_url` but it wasn't clear if that is for a human readable URL or should have the content of `Www-Authenticate`....</small>
