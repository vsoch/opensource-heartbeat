<p>How does starlette get initialized?</p><small>Hi! I'm interested in trying this out and was very happy to find this example, but I don't see anywhere how the Starlette app folder gets integrated into the Django app. Is this something that you figured out, or am I missing the detail? Thank you!...</small><a href='https://github.com/gbozee/django-starlette/issues/1' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
