<p>where is the code base?</p><small>#hey @OSC! I'm a research software engineer at Stanford, am interested generally in building web/graphical tools for HPC, and saw your webinar announcement. I came to the repo excited to see what you are working on and contribute but... no code! Is the project not open source? I'd love to see how I might contribute, or test things out, this is a great effort and I'd like to see more nice tools for working with HPC tools (eg, I just made this a few days ago [job-maker](http://oss.stanford.edu/job-maker/)) Looking forward to chatting!`...</small><a href='https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/issues/809' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
