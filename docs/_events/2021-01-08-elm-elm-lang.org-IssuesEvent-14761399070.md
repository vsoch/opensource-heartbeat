<p>delete account on discourse?</p><small>Hi Elm! I suspect this is the wrong place to post it, but I'm looking for a contact for how to delete my account on https://discourse.elm-lang.org/. I looked in preferences and didn't see anything, and I don't see a topic board there to talk about account related things. I went to the main site and found the GitHub here, and am hoping this can give me a pointer in the right direction. Sorry for the noise!...</small><a href='https://github.com/elm/elm-lang.org/issues/854' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
