<small>Happy New Year @alecbcs! It indeed would be very nice to support GitHub sources without a personal access token - [go-latest](https://github.com/tcnksm/go-latest) looks good, as long as you are OK with adding another dependency. Would you like me to test and PR when I get the chance?...</small>
