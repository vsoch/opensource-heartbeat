<p>Change name of "whitelist" options to "exclude" options</p><small>It's confusing that the `white_listed_` [inputs](https://github.com/urlstechie/urlchecker-action#inputs) for URLs, patterns, and files **excludes** things rather than **including** them; usually you'd use the term "whitelist" to describe things you are explicitly including that would otherwise not be included....</small><a href='https://github.com/urlstechie/urlchecker-action/issues/72' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
