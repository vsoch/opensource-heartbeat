<p>Create automated check for updates</p><small>It should be easy to run something like `caliper check` or `caliper update` and point at a metric, and first check for new versions, and if there is one, derive an updated result. This will mean that this repository can serve as a database of metrics that updates itself, and users can add metrics by way of adding one to some list!...</small><a href='https://github.com/vsoch/caliper-metrics/issues/1' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
