<small>From the changes to master, it looks like the docker commands have been refactored so there is no longer an import, so I would need to refactor mine as well. If someone that can review this can provide me an overall update on changes that have been done (and then we can discuss how the PR here needs to be changed) that would be hugely appreciated! ...</small>
