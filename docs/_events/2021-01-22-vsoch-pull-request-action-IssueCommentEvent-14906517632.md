<small>hey @shaungrady ! It looks like this is definitely possible: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/pulls#update-a-pull-request. I'll try to take a look soon and see if I can add this. Likely I'd keep the default to still exit if the PR is open, but we could add a variable that you could use to specify wanting an update in this case. I'll definitely try to make some time in the next week or so to work on this, stay tuned!...</small>
