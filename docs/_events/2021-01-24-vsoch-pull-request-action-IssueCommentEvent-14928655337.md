<small>hey @shaungrady - here is a branch for you to test! https://github.com/vsoch/pull-request-action/pull/60 See in the description how it works - if you set `PULL_REQUEST_UPDATE` it will update the existing PR instead of exiting or otherwise ending. I also did some refactoring of the main function body to take advantage of sharing the functions for adding reviewers and assignees regardless of an update or creation, so we will want to check that everything still works. Thank you for testing!...</small>
