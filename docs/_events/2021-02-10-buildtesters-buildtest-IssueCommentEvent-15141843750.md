<small>Good work @shahzebsiddiqui ! If more contributors come along, you can use a strategy like having an AUTHORS or CONTRIBUTORS file (broken into sections like maintainers, contributors) and then you can ask your institution how they want to go about accepting contributions (e.g., either just a note in a PR, or everything up to making them accept a CLA agreement like opencontainers does)....</small>
