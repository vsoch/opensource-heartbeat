<small>Awesome! And thanks for taking a look - this is definitely a work in progress, and we can continue developing when there is more testing and feedback as to how it is now. For example, I think the workflow creation form could be better consolidated into something more dense, and there are a few other issues open (e.g., #13) that will improve functionality greatly....</small>
