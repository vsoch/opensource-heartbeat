<small>Update on this - the number of package collection files is actually too big to rendered on my computer (not enough memory). There are tricks I can do to allow incremental builds, but since my original design has an index to click on any package for a package page, this wouldn't work because those pages would always need to be re-rendered. So although I have all the data, the static interface is likely not going to work, and instead I'll move into developing a more substantial setup with an actual database (hopefully have some time this weekend)....</small>
