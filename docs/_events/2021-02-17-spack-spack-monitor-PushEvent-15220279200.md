<a href='https://github.com/vsoch' target='_blank'>vsoch</a> pushed to <a href='https://github.com/spack/spack-monitor' target='_blank'>spack/spack-monitor</a>

<small>adding update task endpoint.

Note that spack currently is not representing build hashes / transitive specs,
so if one of those fails we dont have a record in the database. So the functoin
to do this update will be changed when we add this
