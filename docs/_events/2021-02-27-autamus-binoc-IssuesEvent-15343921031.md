<p>Idea; namespace branch names</p><small>It looks like the names of the branches are currently in the format `update-<package>` and I'd like to suggest that we provide a namespace for binoc, like `binoc/update-<package>` - that way we can ensure that only branches with prefix `binoc/*` are those that trigger a subsequent action. I'll use the prefix `update-` for now, and we can change this if the action gets it added....</small><a href='https://github.com/autamus/binoc/issues/1' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
