<small>@briveramelo you mentioned wanted to add an entry to the config for network options (or start options) - can you give me an example of what you had in mind? The example provided above only has `--net` - are you saying that given that the user defines custom network args, we forgo the default and use them instead? And then where does fakeroot come in for this step to start the instances? It might help if you can show me what you would want the `singularity-compose.yml` file to look like, and the command that is expected to be generated. Thank you!...</small>
