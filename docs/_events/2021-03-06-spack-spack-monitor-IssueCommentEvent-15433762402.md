<small>This is currently modeled to receive xml (as text) from the libabigail analyzer, as we don't have support for gzip yet. I'm not sure how useful the big text objects are in the table, but we will need to figure out how we want to interact with this data, etc. I'll leave this open if anyone has comments....</small>
