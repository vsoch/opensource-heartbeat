<p>Read corpus from elf path</p><small>I stumbled on a function that I think we can better use to read an application and get a corpus, here: https://github.com/woodard/libabigail/blob/master/src/abg-dwarf-reader.cc#L17424. Specifically, this is how it's done in `abicompat`, differently from `abidw` where the context is created in the function directly. I want to open an issue here as a note to myself to try updating to this simpler form after we get #1 figured out....</small><a href='https://github.com/woodard/libabigail/issues/2' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
