<small>yes! We made a small effort to link to the cognitive atlas with `cognitive_atlas_task_id` https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory-experiments/blob/master/angling_risk_task/config.json#L22 and then could generate this "concept view" https://expfactory.github.io/v1/experiments.html and I agree it would be super cool to expand upon this....</small>
