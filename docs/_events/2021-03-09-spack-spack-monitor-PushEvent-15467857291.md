<small>adding basic build interfaces (#17)

* adding basic build interfaces

this will add a dashboard that shows a table of builds, along with
a build information page that shows three columns with a summary,
details of the build environment, and phase status and output.
We likely will want to tweak this to better fit our needs when we know
what those needs are

* updating table for removed field
