<small>@tgamblin one thing to discuss is when I add a diff analyzer (intended use case to save data files with diffs for the axon graveyard) how we want to organize these functions. Either we can have a diff analyzer that has all the logic imported to the command, the reverse, or something else. The analyzer is going to additionally have the weighted version metric that I made recently to generate the pretty plots....</small>
