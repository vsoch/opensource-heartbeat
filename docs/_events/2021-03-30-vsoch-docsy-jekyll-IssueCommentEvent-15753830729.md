<small>Sure thing! Just to be clear - you don't need that third repo. The point of a template is to be able to point to it in your config.yaml, and then just add the changes to your repository. This includes content _and_ style / images / includes, whatever you want to change. So 1. you shouldn't need your forked repo, and 2. the custom content goes into the repo that you linked above that will have the remote specified in the config....</small>
