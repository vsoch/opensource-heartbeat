<small>Quick update - it worked great! 30 minutes down from 1 hour 20, and there is only one issue with the Kibana container, the version seems to be downgraded from what it was previously: https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-hpc/pull/319/files#diff-f4fb54b9e9a19d6a9e8420c0cd084532d6111b26ef56fecbb0684831643e0e78R7. I think that's the only issue I see....</small>
