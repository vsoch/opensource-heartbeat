<small>Yes, you likely want to edit that startscript to have the start command, unless you are okay using exec. If you are having trouble I can probably help you test it out over the weekend with singularity-compose: https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-compose/#/. which will just provide an easy wrapper to doing all this. But you'd have to be willing to share your container recipe to some extent. if not, check out some of the examples https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-compose-examples....</small>
