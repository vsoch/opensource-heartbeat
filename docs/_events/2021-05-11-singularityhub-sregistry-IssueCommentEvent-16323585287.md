<small>@JossWhittle please see https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/pull/363. Instead of pinning versions in the docker-compose (which is hard to maintain) I added a section to the docs, and comments alongside the image names. When you get a chance could you please test? When we merge that PR there will be a container build and deploy to quay, and I can also draft a release here....</small>
