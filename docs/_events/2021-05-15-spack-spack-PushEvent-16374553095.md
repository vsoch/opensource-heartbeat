<small>some fixes for command help strings (#23658)

- [x] `analyze` isn't commonly used; move it to long help
      (`spack -H` vs `spack -h`). Give it its own section.

- [x] make it clear from `spack -h` that `spack module` can generate
      module files

- [x] shorten help for `spack style`</small>
