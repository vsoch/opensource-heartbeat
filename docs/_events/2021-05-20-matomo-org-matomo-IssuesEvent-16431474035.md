<p>docker-compose recipe?</p><small>Hi Matomo! I'm looking to get this running on an instance, and I'm wondering if anyone has set up a docker-compose recipe for it? I saw the docker-compose.yml in the .gitignore so I suspect that one used to exist, it exists locally for some developer. Any pointers to work started in this direction would be greatly appreciated! I'd definitely rather use containers than installing everything natively. If there is more development/help needed to create this recipe I could also offer. Thank you!...</small><a href='https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/issues/17599' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
