<small>Works great! https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/pull/367. I added to my blog, and also put out a tweet (I couldn't find your Twitter username otherwise would have pinged you). I'll likely add to other projects as I realize how bad the spelling is :p Thanks for this great tool!...</small>
