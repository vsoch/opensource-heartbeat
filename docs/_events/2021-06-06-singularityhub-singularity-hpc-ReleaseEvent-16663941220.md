<a href='https://github.com/vsoch' target='_blank'>vsoch</a> released <a href='https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-hpc/releases/tag/0.0.27' target='_blank'>0.0.27</a>.

<small>This release includes:

 - cleanup of module files from @xdelaruelle
 - removal of unneeded `SINGULARITY_COMMAND_ARGS` environment variable from modules 
 -  bugfix that the `DockerContainer` base was requiring Docker to be installed for Podman. We could generalize the function to ensure that podman was checked for podman, and docker for docker
