<p>Support for renamed and modified</p><small>Hi! I'm loving using your action, and just ran into a case where I had a file renamed _and_ modified. I'm currently using the added_modified output, and I was puzzled that it didn't show up in that set. If the name `added_modified` indicates added OR modified, I'm wondering why the renamed file does not appear there? I don't think it means added _and_ modified because it definitely triggers for files that are existing and just changed....</small><a href='https://github.com/jitterbit/get-changed-files/issues/37' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
