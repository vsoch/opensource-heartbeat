<small>I did create the original commit in the GitHub interface and then pulled and rebased, so that might be why the two are different? I can close here and re-do again if you want... this seems like an extraordinary amount of work to just remove one line! I'm not sure why it's always so hard to contribute to these repos :/ ...</small>
