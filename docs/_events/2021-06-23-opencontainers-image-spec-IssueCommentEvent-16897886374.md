<small>@reidpr that would be useful I think - if you want to put that here, then I can take a first shot at a suggested update to the current spec - I'll start in a Google Doc and then can open a PR here for more fine tuned discussion. If you like I can also make the Google Doc first and then you can add notes to it. Let me know which is easiest for you!...</small>
