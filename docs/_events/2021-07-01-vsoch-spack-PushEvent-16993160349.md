<small>adding ability to compare git references to spack install

This works by way of adding a property, is_commit, to a version, and then given that a version
is a commit, we return a GitFetcherStrategy to use it. In additional, we instruct
the version command to generate a lookup of commits that keeps track of the order
(for comparing between commits) and the previous and next spack version (for comparison
of a commit with a spack version string). If the commit does not have known releases before
it, then the previous is None and we cannot determine the relationship and return False.
The same is true if the commit does not have any known releases after it, although it
is unlikely to hit this case unless the user is asking for a version that has been
released but not added to spack.
