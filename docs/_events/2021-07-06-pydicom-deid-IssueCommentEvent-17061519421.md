<small>@wetzelj yes this is so much better! I was thinking about how the design for this function is different from all others (e.g., it interacts with the dicom directly) and that's an artifact of how deid was originally designed. If you want to PR with this update I'll review asap and totally okay to replace this branch of work....</small>
