<p>Copyright, attribution, etc questions for my fork</p><small>Hi @vsoch , I am posting here to let you know that I have forked this awesome theme and am maintaining an unsynced repo. I have maintained heavy attribution and all your copyright notices and so forth, but that this point I think there is little left of your original code, and most of it is in the general layouts and templates. I expected to hue much closer to what you had, because I really liked it, but at this point I'm more concerned that your name is all over something that maybe doesn't look much like your work....</small><a href='https://github.com/vsoch/docsy-jekyll/issues/47' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
