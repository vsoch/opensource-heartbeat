<small>spack diff: make output order deterministic (#25169)

The output order for `spack diff` is nondeterministic for larger diffs -- if you
ran it several times it will not put the fields in the spec in the same order on
successive invocations.

This makes a few fixes to `spack diff`:

- [x] Implement the change discussed in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/22283#discussion_r598337448
      to make `AspFunction` comparable in and of itself and to eliminate the need for `to_tuple()`

- [x] Sort the lists of diff properties so that the output is always in the same order.

- [x] Make the output for different fields the same as what we use in the solver. Previously, we
      would use `Type(value)` for non-string values and `value` for strings.  Now we just use
      the value.  So the output looks a little cleaner:

      ```

I suppose if we want to use `repr()` in the output we could do that and could be
consistent but we don't do that elsewhere -- the types of things in Specs are
all stringifiable so the string and the name of the attribute (`version`, `node_os`,
etc.) are sufficient to know what they are.</small>
