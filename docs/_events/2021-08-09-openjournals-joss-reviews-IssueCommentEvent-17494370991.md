<small>Thank you @mariojmdavid. Just to be transparent, my concerns were there from the beginning, and I emailed the editor here and was sort of pushed in the direction of "I think this is okay" (subtext you should too) and I proceeded with the review. I didn't feel that I had the power or right to be assertive about my opinion, so I stopped there. I think if I were truly in charge I would have concluded (before any review) that I didn't consider this second paper appropriate for a piece of software that already exists and has been published - in my mind updates to or new features, refactor to different structure or language, does not constitute enough for a paper. And I proceeded rather submissively thinking I didn't think I really had a choice to outright reject reviewing it. ...</small>
