<small>I think it's risky to explicitly state a set of "RSE skills," especially on the main website, because someone reading it might say "Oh, that's not me, I don't belong in this community after all." The reason that job descriptions are OK is because one job is sort of understood to not be all encompassing for all the things an RSE could be. But a page on a site called "RSE skills" sends a different message I think....</small>
