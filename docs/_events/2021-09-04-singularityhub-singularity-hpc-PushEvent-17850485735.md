<small>adding first shot at new features

this first commit will add a new feature, x11, which will be null by default. If the
value is True, we default to binding ~/.Xauthority. if it is found to be a string, we use that
instead. This means if there needs to be some custom bind like ~/.special-Xauthority TO the ~/.Xauthority,
both of those need to be represented in the single string.
