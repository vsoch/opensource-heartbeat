<small>Hey Sam! I would compare your install with the autamus install in this container, where it built successfully. https://github.com/orgs/autamus/packages/container/samtools/8136304?tag=1.13. Indeed it could be version or something like that. Let me know if you have any questions, or tell us what you find! Everything in the container should be under /opt....</small>
