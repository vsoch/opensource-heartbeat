<small>Okay - Dockerfile and README are updated with the full development workflow that seems to work! This could be extended to point to a quick start guide to show the user a basic CMakeLists.txt (or other setup) but probably for a seasoned Dyninst developer, the most likely user of this, that isn't necessary....</small>
