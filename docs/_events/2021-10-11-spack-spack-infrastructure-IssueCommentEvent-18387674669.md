<small>@opadron are there ever plans to merge the recipes here, or will they stay in this staging ground like the drift server? Okay either way, but if they are never going to merged here I'll add them to the spack-monitor repository with a bunch of instructions for how to do it. If they will get merged here eventually, I guess after we get the new storage working a merge will be possible (and I can link to them here from the spack-monitor docs?)...</small>
