<small>Enable analysis (#40)

* adding support for larger builds
also sorting the front page table with fails /cancelled at the top, fixing
a bug with by user filter, and making the default table size 100

* start of work to enable analyses
combined with spack being able to analyze all versions, and all dependents of a package,
this is the start of work for the server to be able to have the uploaded json value/results.
Next I will work on views for that.

* adding abi diff view
* tweaks to spack monitor analyze (smeagle) interface
* add support for basic splicing interface
* tweaking views to have better filtering
