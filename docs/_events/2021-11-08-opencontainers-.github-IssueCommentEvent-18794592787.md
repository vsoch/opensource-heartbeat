<small>These were ideal when the docs content was being rendered as a site so it could be previewed. If that's not the case anymore (which it is not) then these are safe to remove. I've also reproduced the content (I spent quite a bit of time on it!) on a site that currently is deployed so it's not lost in GitHub markdown forever :laughing: https://rse-ops.github.io/knowledge/docs/containers/docker/...</small>
