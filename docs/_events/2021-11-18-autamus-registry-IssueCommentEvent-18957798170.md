<small>I can also give a shot at doing this build outside of the context of autamus, and just using a Dockerfile template instead of trying to use what spack produces. And then I'd still want to see if we can use that context to upload to the build cache. My goal is to be able to start with this automated approach to find spack.yaml files in the wild, clone the respective repos, and then build a container for the environment....</small>
