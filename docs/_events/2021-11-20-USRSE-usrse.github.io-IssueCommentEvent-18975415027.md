<small>Oh and one more note - for any pages that are replaced (e.g., if right now we have https://us-rse.org/resources/training/ and we want that to be under the education and training working group, maybe like `https://us-rse.org/education-training/<name>` the way we can do that to preserve links is added a redirect page under pages/redirects. it's fairly straight forward - in the frontend matter you define the permalink and the redirect URL. ...</small>
