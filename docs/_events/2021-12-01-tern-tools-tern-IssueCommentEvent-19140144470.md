<small>Thank you for this help! Tern is now added to spack, so people can try out install via there, or if interested in Docker/Singularity containers there is a containerize command to do the same and generate in a dockerfile, or modules too. https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/27599#event-5701960443...</small>
