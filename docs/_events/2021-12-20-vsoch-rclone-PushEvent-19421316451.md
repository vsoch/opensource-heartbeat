<small>cmd: fix broken example link in help.go

This link appears to be broken, so here is another reference to (I think) the same file that provides a good example of coba. We could also do the current commit https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/8312004f41e9500824fa16ae991eeee0083f4771/cli/cobra.go although it might be better to maintain an up to date example.</small>
