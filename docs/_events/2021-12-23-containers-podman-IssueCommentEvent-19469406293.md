<small>Understood! So thinking about 4.0 - is there a plan underway to improve the developer experience of using libpod, or is this something we should open conversation about what we would like? @alecbcs and I are working on a tool (and were hoping to have Podman be the default container backend) but the socket isn't going to work for our use-case. Ideally we'd like a stable developer Go API, so I think we are definitely willing to help if that's a discussion to have! If not, we are also okay issuing commands to podman via a subprocess/shell and then waiting for 4.0, at which point maybe the issue will be solved or we can start the conversation again. What do you think @rhatdan?...</small>
