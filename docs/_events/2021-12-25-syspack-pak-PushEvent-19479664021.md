<small>the uri parsing is really part of core pack, and better suited in libpak

I am also adding a string (str) module to provide helper functions for strings. The URI parsing
also seems weird as a generic library because it is specific to parsing containers, but we could
change this in the future. Finally, this adds the working pak ls command!
