<small>It's a nice book! The main difference (as I see it) is that this still is going to have the repos as separate. E.g., you can't easily click from the runtime docs to the distribution docs. Another layer would be needed to bring them together, and that still would be ultimately clicking between different sites. We also would want more customization to be able to open an issue, edit on GitHub etc....</small>
