<p>Output in workflow != local</p><small>@davidbeckingsale I updated uptodate with a fix for the exclude matrices, but when I pull the container I can't reproduce the output in the job https://github.com/rse-ops/docker-images/runs/4682583744?check_suite_focus=true e.g., the excludes don't seem to be excluded there? Could you take another look / be another set of eyes to see if maybe I am just not seeing something - did I add the exclude to the right file?...</small><a href='https://github.com/rse-ops/docker-images/issues/51' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
