<small>okay fixed! I tested with your allowlist (thank you!) and there were many printed without notallowed (the allowed). Let me know what other examples of summary / similar you are looking for (a concrete example with the singularity_latest.sif and the allow list we have as the example or your custom one here would work best for me to reproduce)....</small>
