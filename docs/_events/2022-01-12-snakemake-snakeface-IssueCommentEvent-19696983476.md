<small>If I had to guess, it might be that it failed to authenticate you (and your server requires it) https://github.com/snakemake/snakeface/blob/0928c8607608c0518d6cb279a4a506c5e1f85431/snakeface/apps/api/views.py#L75 but I can probably give you a better answer with some quick debugging! Could you point me to the workflow you are using so either this evening / the weekend I can take a look? It's probably time for some maintenance of snakeface anyway so I'm happy to test in full....</small>
