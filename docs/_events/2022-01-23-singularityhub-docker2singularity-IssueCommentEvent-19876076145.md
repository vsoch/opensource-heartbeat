<small>Ug, I'm sorry about that! I would reach out to them and report the error and have a conversation about Singularity. This is a conversation people were having years ago (2016 / 2017) and I'm sorry that your cluster doesn't seem to have real support for it. If they say that it's installed, then perhaps ask them how you can pull an image from Docker Hub without that? Perhaps they expect you to pull locally, and then scp onto the cluster to use? It's annoying but it could possibly work....</small>
