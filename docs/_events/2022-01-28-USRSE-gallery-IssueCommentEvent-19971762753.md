<small>Yeah it would work to remove, although I'm not sure we'd have a ton of pictures left! We could also make a separate eat-street gallery, or just delete. I'd like this page to perhaps be something like a document archive so it would warrant a rename and a bit of a refactor anyway, happy to do some change that others agree with is warranted....</small>
