<p>Question: does it handle concurrency?</p><small>Hi! I'm browsing around to learn about real time machine learning and I stumbled on this repo. You mention using dicts for data, and also have an example of a flask app to update a mode l- https://riverml.xyz/latest/user-guide/reading-data/ but does river handle concurrency? E.g., I'm trying to figure out what best practices are for making a production server with the main purpose of receiving new data and updating a model. The logical thing is to keep some queue of new entries and run a batch update overnight, but I'm hoping there are more sophisticated "real time" methods that somehow map the model to the database. Thanks!...</small><a href='https://github.com/online-ml/river/issues/834' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
