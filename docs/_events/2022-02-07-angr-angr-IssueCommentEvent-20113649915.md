<small>@ltfish is it correct that we can't go any further (because structs and maybe others aren't parsed) or is there a workaround? Or something I can help with or debug? I made pretty good progress on Friday and the weekend (https://github.com/buildsi/smeagle-python) - and I really like the library and am hoping I can parse all the different remaining types....</small>
