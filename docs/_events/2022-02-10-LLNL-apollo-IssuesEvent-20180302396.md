<p>Update description</p><small>hey apollo team! I think it would be good to come up with a slightly tweaked description for the project, because it technically isn't online (incremental) learning. I was chatting in Mattermost with @davidbeckingsale about it. I don't know the project well enough to make a suggestion - but is it some kind of batch ML server perhaps?...</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/apollo/issues/19' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
