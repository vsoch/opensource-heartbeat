<small>adding support for spack sbom

we want to be able to generate software bills of material (sboms) for spack packages.
These changes add a new install flag --sbom that asks to generate one in the install
directory, a common group spack sbom to further view a path or show the sbom or
generate an sbom for a spec after install, and finally tests and docs for that.
CycloneDX seems to be a reasonable format to choose, however we could add more in the
future if needed.
