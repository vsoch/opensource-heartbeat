<small>@hainest refactor done to remove inline and try to reduce redundancy of function! I think we probably need to be passing the allocator from the top level function and use reference/pointer to save state but I wasn't sure how to do that (do we need to change the classify template thing?) I might need some pointers for how to do that because what I tried didn't work!...</small>
