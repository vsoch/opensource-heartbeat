<small>Hmm - should we maybe have a different section? My worry is that our board is going to be harder to navigate for someone looking for a US-based job. I don't think we should turn away outside-US jobs, but I think we should separate them so it's clear, and someone looking for one or the other doesn't have to sift through both!...</small>
