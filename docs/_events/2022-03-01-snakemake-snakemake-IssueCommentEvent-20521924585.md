<small>I may not need to help if you have the full traceback! Here is where that seems to be in the client code: https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/8e9750ee4fde0a531d1b7085d660fbe04d8f1e4e/googleapiclient/_helpers.py#L111-L131. I'm seeing it happens right after ssl.py so it might be related to that?...</small>
