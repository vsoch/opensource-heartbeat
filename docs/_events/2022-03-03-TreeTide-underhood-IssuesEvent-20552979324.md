<p>codeunderhood.com still online?</p><small>Hi! I wanted to check out [codeunderhood.com](https://codeunderhood.com/) but it's just infinitely spinning (and I suspect will time out). Is this a temporary thing or is it permanently offline? If the latter, do you have a container build that would make it easy to preview locally, or someone using it that I could look at? Thanks!...</small><a href='https://github.com/TreeTide/underhood/issues/69' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
