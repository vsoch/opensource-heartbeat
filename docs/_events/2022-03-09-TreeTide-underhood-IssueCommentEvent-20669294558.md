<small>Worked perfectly! So a question for you - what are the limits of scaling this? E.g., I see in the demo Dockerfile you are cloning each repo and then running the indexer. In practice I think that would work for a small number of repos, especially if you have to keep them around! How would it work for say, repos in the thousands, each with anywhere between 1 and 25 releases? Would the source code need to come from its own database, and then the index the same? I'm trying to figure out if it will work for a few use cases I have in mind. Thank you!...</small>
