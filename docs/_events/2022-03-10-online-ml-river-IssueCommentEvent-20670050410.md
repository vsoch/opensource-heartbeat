<small>@smastelini I do really like the idea of having algorithms use a common shared set of functions, when possible!  I think I've seen some of that already with stuffs coming out of utils? I'll keep this in mind as I test other clustering models (after we discuss changes here I'm going to try the same for [DenStream](https://riverml.xyz/latest/api/cluster/DenStream/)....</small>
