<small>Worked like a charm! The [first run](https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-hpc/runs/5562349451?check_suite_focus=true) added new contributors and all metadata, then the [second run](https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-hpc/runs/5562429714?check_suite_focus=true) didn't find anything. (no second PR). Right now it's sort of a bug that the first update finds new GitHub aliases, and then it takes a second one to use other extractors to get metadata about them. ...</small>
