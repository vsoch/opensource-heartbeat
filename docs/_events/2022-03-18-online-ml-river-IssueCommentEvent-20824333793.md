<small>Yes, that is satisfactory! So I think all of the details you provide above should be in the docs - specifically on the page where the person is reading about the parameters and the algorithm. And I think it's important to note that we are using a modified algorithm (maybe say "inspired by" this paper?) Otherwise the reader will (as I did) go and look at the paper and try to compare things 1:1 in the case of a bug or confusion, etc....</small>
