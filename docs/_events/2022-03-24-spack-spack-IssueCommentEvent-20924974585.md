<small>well, for spack monitor's sake it really just needs a unique id for the spec. It was a pretty arbitrary decision when it was first made. Technically we can present any of the hashes (changed and newly deemed worthy) for it to use. If the key is wrong for the server, the easiest thing to do will be just to add full_hash to be whatever spack is now using (e.g., dag)....</small>
