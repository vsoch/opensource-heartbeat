<small>@muffato just to follow up here - I think we want to see some kind of tweak /rebase so these version changes don't show up here anymore (that are now deprecated in favor of the other PRs that we worked on!) I'm not sure the best way to go about it if it's not trivial to fix, but let me know what you'd suggest....</small>
