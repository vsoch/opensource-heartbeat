<small>I recall tags being part of v1 maybe? https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/blob/a076fc15c1322fa2e145067c38825c8575168b56/shub/apps/library/urls.py#L64. For the updated version I think tagging was a bit of an afterthought - like do the whole interaction first and then tell the registry the tag to apply. Ping @dtrudg in case he doesn't see this (he will know the right person to ask!)...</small>
