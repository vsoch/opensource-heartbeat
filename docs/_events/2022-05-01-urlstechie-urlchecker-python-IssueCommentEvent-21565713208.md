<small>Thank you for your hard work here! I think the thing we were running into is that it's hard to integrate pre-commit into the client here because the design is different. Please see https://github.com/urlstechie/urlchecker-python/issues/54#issuecomment-1114330834 as my suggestion for adding it! :partying_face: If this is good we can add more docs there, share it more widely, and see what it takes to publish in the public collection. If you have bandwidth, I'm interested in a quick review and testing for more advanced cases, e.g.,: 1.running with just pre-commit run, and 2. adding custom arguments for maybe a filetype....</small>
