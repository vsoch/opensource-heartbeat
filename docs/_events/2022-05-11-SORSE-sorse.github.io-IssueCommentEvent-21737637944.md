<small>hey @PYTHON3610 ! I think this event is now passed so we don't have further work on this particular site (until it or a similar event happens again) but if you want to join the society's slack (instructions here) https://society-rse.org/join-us/ you can probably get notified when there is a new/future effort to make something....</small>
