<small>I'm good with that too @sajayantony ! I am here at your service for all the issues / feature requests that come in, and I'm going to keep working on the things I noted above, and probably think of more as I go. I'm not experienced with oras-go but it would be fairly easy to look there and get a sense of what I'm missing, environment variable and interaction wise. I also want to get that GitHub example up with developer docs (for using the Python API) sooner than later....</small>
