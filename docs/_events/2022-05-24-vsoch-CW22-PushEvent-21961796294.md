<small>Adding "Ten Suggested Practices for Software Design"

Here is my Whitepaper contribution for Collegeville 2022! I really enjoyed writing this, so thank you for the opportunity. I noticed after the fact you wanted a different latex format, and I'd be happy to provide this on request, although my main incentive isn't publication so no worries if you don't choose mine.</small>
