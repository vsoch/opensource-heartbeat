<p>This is so cool!</p><small>hey @cmillion ! I love this! Is there an opportunity to make some kind of template, either a web interface you can export from or even just a template repository with a simple set of sections that pretty render into a project document on pages. It could even be a combination of that and then pre=populated Google sheets, etc. We could make it as a project in https://github.com/rseng if you are interested.
