<small>Ah gotcha! Also I was testing newer versions of docker (on Linux/Ubuntu) and the function behavior wasn't consistent (e.g., updating broke some functions) so that is what first incentivized me to want to remove it / make it optional. Likely we will need a user that has a more complicated docker config setup to know if/what is missing....</small>
