<small>hey @marcodelapierre ! I can definitely review this soon - do you have an opinion about what we should do with #545 ? It seems like we had some momentum and then needed to make a final decision and there was radio silence. I want to be careful about adding things on top of that because it might be much harder to resolve merge conflicts. Is the conclusion that adding views isn't a good idea / wanted enough at this time?...</small>
