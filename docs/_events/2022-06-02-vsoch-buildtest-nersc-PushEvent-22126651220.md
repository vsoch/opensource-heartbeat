<small>Update urlcheck.yml

We are going to be deprecating older versions of urlchecker (and there was a change in versioning to match the upstream package so the version only appears earlier) so I wanted to update here to make sure your workflows do not break! To be clear, 0.0.27 is actually the newest release. https://github.com/urlstechie/urlchecker-action/releases/tag/0.0.27

The updated versions also run about 7x as fast, so that's an added bonus!</small>
