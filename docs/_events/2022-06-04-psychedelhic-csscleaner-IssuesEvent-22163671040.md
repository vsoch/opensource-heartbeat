<p>Did you ever write this?</p><small>Hiya! I was looking up the name "csscleaner" on pypi and I found this project, which hasn't had activity for almost 10 years? Did y'all ever write this?

Thanks!...</small><a href='https://github.com/psychedelhic/csscleaner/issues/2' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
