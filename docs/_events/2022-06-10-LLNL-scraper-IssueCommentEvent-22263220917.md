<small>@IanLee1521 not sure why tests aren't running here (perhaps GH-actions are disabled) but I opened a PR to my branch to show working: https://github.com/researchapps/scraper/actions/runs/2472598848. I also ran the version here against the (currently broken but with the patch here fixed!) contributor-ci action: https://github.com/vsoch/contributor-ci/runs/6824670095?check_suite_focus=true. Works! So I think it would be great to have a release soon, and of course let me know if you want more work here. ...</small>
