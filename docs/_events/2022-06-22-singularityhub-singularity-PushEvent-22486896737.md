<small>start of work to add singularity build from Dockerfile support

This is a prototype or proof of concept that we can build from Dockerfile
The work here currently includes support for FROM/ADD/COPY/ENV/LABEL/CMD/ENTRYPOINT
and is setup to also include support for multistage builds (although this needs to be finished
and I need to look into how singularity handles this with respect to copying files between stages.
There is no expectation of merging this, it was a lot of fun to work on / figure out and I learned
a lot!
