<small>Wanted to post a quick update that I got it working - I had to modify the command quite a bit for my setup! I'm going to do a short writeup that I'll share (maybe not today but tomorrow) for others to find in case it's useful. Someone did report that the above worked for them on a Mac (and different cluster resource) so I suspect it has to do with the slight variation in our clusters / setups. Anyway, will write that post soon!...</small>
