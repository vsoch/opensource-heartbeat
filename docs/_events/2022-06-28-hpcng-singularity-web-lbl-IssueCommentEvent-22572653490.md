<small>Thanks for your comment in the discussion @gmkurtzer! "Current" documentation could mean either Apptainer or Singularity, depending on what the user is looking for. Many would see it as lacking transparency to say that there is only one project, and disagree with you about Apptainer being "the" Singularity, at least based on folks that I've talked to. This isn't about the historical squabbles between projects, it's about transparency and helping the user that stumbles onto the old page. The original documentation for the parent project has grown into both projects. Can we not be supportive of one another, and for cases like this clearly communicate that both projects exist? If it's such a small set of links as @DrDaveD has said, why is there such fight against this?...</small>
