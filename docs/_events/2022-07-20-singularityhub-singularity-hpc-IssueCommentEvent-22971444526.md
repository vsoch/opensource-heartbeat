<small>OK - I have a design I think I like to start? I've removed the WIP from #567 - I have basic tests but to be fair I don't have a good way to fully test the upgrade from a remote (instead I test upgrade from a local). I'm thinking we might want a dummy remote repository to test from, or actually I could just use shpc here. I'm too tired tonight to do that, so it's on my TODO for tomorrow. Even without that, there should be enough to take a look! ...</small>
