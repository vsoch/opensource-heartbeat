<p>[Docs]: Documentation for unix socket deployment?</p><small>Hi! I'm not sure if this is possible because I can't find it - but I'm looking to run the container and instead of specifying a hostname/port, I want to specify a `--socket` instead (akin to how jupyter notebook does it). Is there support/documentation for this? The use case is running on remote servers that don't allow you to map ports (sockets work here!) Thank you!...</small><a href='https://github.com/coder/code-server/issues/5423' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
