<small>This is now (mostly done) at https://github.com/vsoch/cle (note I'm using a "main" for the main branch instead of master). It might not be what is desired here, but I've tried to stay up to date with angr master so it's something we could consider, if there is interest. If not, feel free to close the issue!...</small>
