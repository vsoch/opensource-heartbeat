<small>hey @ricardozanini ! Ready for your help! I have a PR branch here https://github.com/urlstechie/urlchecker-action/pull/100 that would be super helpful if you can test - instead of `urlchecker-action@main` do `urlchecker-action@update/fakeuser-agent`. Let me know if that resolves the issue! If so, I have a PR in to urlchecker-python to fix the underlying issue, and that will propogate to a new container to release here. Thank you!...</small>
