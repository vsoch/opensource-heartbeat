<small>it's okay @faroit - thank you so kindly for moving it along! I have a pretty cool project under development called tunel that I'll eventually submit, so I'll definitely be back for a next time! I'm trying to limit myself to one paper  / year to not overwhelm the process - I'm just really appreciative for JoSS! I tend to not be a fan of publication as a means to derive our worth but I think y'all are doing it right - a focus on reviewing the code, testing, and documentation. Happy Monday!...</small>
