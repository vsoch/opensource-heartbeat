<small>I ask because it's been an issue over the years - a few years back there was a huge change to pydicom so the exact version pin was warranted, but now the changes are incremental and the pin is causing more headaches than it's alleviating. So I would say to try for min_version, and if someone opens a bug with respect to an update we can address it....</small>
