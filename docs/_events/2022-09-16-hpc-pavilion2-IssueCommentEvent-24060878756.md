<small>This seems to be the library from: https://github.com/lanl-preteam/yaml_config. However the install deps script is forcing the user to create a venv, and then it's creating a bunch of dead symbolic links to its own lib directory. I'm confused because either we can use pip (and install to our preference of Python) or there is an approach like spack takes (and we do not use pip). When I write my own install routine to be able to use my preferred python, I hit #539. Thanks!...</small>
