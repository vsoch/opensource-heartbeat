<small>okay I've tested the entire thing from a fresh build to login -> push -> pull, and updated the docs accordingly. https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/pull/405. I did the entire workflow without https and couldn't reproduce your issue (using the new minio) so I think my advice (if you can't get the above working) is to step back and test first without https, and add when you are sure that is working. If you test from my branch it should also be using a newer Python and have the bugs fixed that we chat about, so it might be a good idea too....</small>
