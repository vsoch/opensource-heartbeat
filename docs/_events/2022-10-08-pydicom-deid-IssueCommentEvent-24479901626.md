<small>Sure thing! If you get an error like this in the future, a good way to debug is to sanity check things - e.g., if it's telling you that you can't import something, look there to see if the function name exists (as we did). And then compare your version against the latest in version control, or if it were something else (e.g, let's say you were running things with multiprocessing) you could try the same commands in a more vanilla environment. Glad to help!...</small>
