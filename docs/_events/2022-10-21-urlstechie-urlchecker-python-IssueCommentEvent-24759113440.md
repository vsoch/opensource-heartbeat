<small>@danschef the creator of the library has filed an issue with pypi - it's a complicated situation because we need the new library - the previous developer (that has the pypi package) hasn't updated it since 2020 (and I hope he/she is OK). For now it's a bug, and hopefully if/when the package gets on pypi for a future version this will be fixed!...</small>
