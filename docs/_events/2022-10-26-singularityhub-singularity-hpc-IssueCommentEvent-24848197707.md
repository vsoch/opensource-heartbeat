<small>To keep you in the loop, this is an example of the new workflow that does updates incrementally - https://github.com/singularityhub/shpc-registry/pull/30/files. That will be important when there are 8K plus! That uses this action I put together last night: https://github.com/vsoch/split-list-action. I'm going to let it run a few days to make sure it works as I expect, and then I'll hold my breath and merge in the 8k new ones. If you want to take a look at that PR and do some spot checks for the executables in the meantime that would be very helpful!...</small>
