<small>okay please see https://github.com/vsoch/puzzles/pull/101! We will need more work to handle dimensions, but this is a start. Thanks for opening the issue - we had only developed this for simple images (without a lot of white) and will try to improve it. If you want to contribute please also feel free to go ahead!...</small>
