<small>okay the other tags look OK - I'm still worried something is happening, because this is the second container I've seen with a tag (that maybe was previously there?) suddenly not. Either there is a bug in creating the original file, or GitHub is somehow removing tags. I'll leave this open to post other issues that might arise so we can better look into it....</small>
