<p>CircleCI Workflow update to GitHub Actions</p><small>Hi USRSE! The repository here is deploying via my bot's token, and I can no longer provide this and want to suggest you update to perform the push in GitHub actions. Don't worry - I already wrote the workflow: https://github.com/hpc-social/blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-posts.yaml just need someone to add it here. I'll revoke my bot permissions at the end of the week, but let me know if you need more time. Thanks!...</small><a href='https://github.com/USRSE/blog/issues/38' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
