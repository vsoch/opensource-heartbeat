<small>Thanks @javitab! I'll add this to my list of TODO but it's quite chonky at the moment so I might not get to testing it out immediately. Thanks for figuring out a reproducing case! We did recently have changes to the cleaner (the coordinate system was off I think) so I wouldn't be surprised if there is a bug....</small>
