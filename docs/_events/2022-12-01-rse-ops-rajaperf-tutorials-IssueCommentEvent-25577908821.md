<small>Definitely! So I can add those packages to my Nix TODO - I actually already have caliper :) So you are wanting in addition papi, and then maybe give umpire a shot?  I'm enjoying making these so would be happy to, even it if doesn't hit this set of containers. I'm still learning good practices myself for Nix in containers (right now I have a  base that is based on Ubuntu so I can still use apt-get in an emergency) https://github.com/rse-ops/nix-images/pkgs/container/nix-ubuntu and it's also designed so it works with vscode....</small>
