<small>start of work for aws prices and region filtering (#6)

* start of work for aws prices and region filtering
* automation docker build
* addition of "Regions" attribute to AWS instance data, allowing for --region to be a filter string (Google already had it)
* addition of sorting based on field, and ascending order of results
* a parameter in settings to ask to use the cache only (set now to false, will be true when we can provide remote cache)
* filtering by regions for both instances AWS/Google
* moved original design notes into separate doc in docs (preparing for prettier docs at some point)
