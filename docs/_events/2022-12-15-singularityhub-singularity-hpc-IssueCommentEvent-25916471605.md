<small>Oh this looks super cool @georgiastuart ! If you make an rpm recipe for shpc we can maybe add it alongside a repository here for others to use (or even make it's own repository?) I'd like to learn more about these module deps too - I think the shpc view.yaml (that you can store somewhere and then install from) might be a good starting point for a logical group of applications?...</small>
