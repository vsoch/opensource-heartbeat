<small>hey everyone! Another update! The action is working well https://github.com/rse-ops/release-actions/ and is now added to the flux framework repository, where it added [19 releases from 2022](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-framework.github.io/pull/59/files)! I've updated the issue to have some action items - the next of which is to work on the interface itself. I'm going to do some work right now on the Flux Operator / RESTful API but I will definitely (likely) get to this UI refactor this weekend. Have a good one y'all and thanks for the discussion above - excited to work on this and share what I come up with for feedback! :partying_face:...</small>
