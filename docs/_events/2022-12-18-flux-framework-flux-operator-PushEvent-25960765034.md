<a href='https://github.com/vsoch' target='_blank'>vsoch</a> pushed to <a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator' target='_blank'>flux-framework/flux-operator</a>

<small>updates so precommand and flux option args are on the level of the container

this has been tested with and without option args and seems
to work for both! We are also using more proper templating
in go instead of what I was doing before. Next I need to be
able to write tests to ensure these workflos do not break.
