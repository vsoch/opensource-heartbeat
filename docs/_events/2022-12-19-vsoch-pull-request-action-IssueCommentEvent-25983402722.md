<small>Do you do a lot with your org and the GitHub API? The token I would suspect would apply to the global ratelimit for your user or org. That might explain, but it's hard to know. To me, it doesn't look like this is a problem with the action, but rather the message being reported is correct that you (somehow) went over your limit. I think the question is if that message would appear even with the presence of a token (this I am not sure about) I've only see it when I forget to export, and I usually don't get anywhere near the limit! ...</small>
