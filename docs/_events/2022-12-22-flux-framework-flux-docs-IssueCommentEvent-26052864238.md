<small>okay last action item for the portal - dark mode! https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-framework.github.io/pull/68 I really struggled with the position of the slider - When I put it in the navbar no matter what I did I couldn't get it to move down ever so slightly (and look visually correct). I think my preference would be for it to be there, but not hugging the top of the page. @hauten I suspect you have good css chops if you want to take a look! This is the first time I've implemented a dark mode from scratch and it was kind of neat - the trick is to have variables in your .css styling, and then have them link to a data-theme that corresponds to each of the styles (and then have that save in the local storage so a user preference is saved). ...</small>
