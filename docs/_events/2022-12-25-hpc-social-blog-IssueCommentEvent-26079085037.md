<small>hey @MiddelkoopT I wanted to let you know we are doing some organizing, and placed CaRCC in the bucket of community projects: https://hpc.social/community-blog/. The original site here now is a portal to these new spaces!  https://hpc.social/blog/. We are hoping this makes the blog space we host more inclusive for different kinds of blogs - the current one was strongly "personal blogs" and I suspect some orgs would feel they didn't belong....</small>
