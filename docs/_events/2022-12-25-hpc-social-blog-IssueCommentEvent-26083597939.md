<small>oh right, I forgot about the page there! That's actually the perfect spot to put more about information if you like! For that page I would just link the current blog link directly to the portal, and the "how to contribute your blog" is in one place for all blogs, here: https://github.com/hpc-social/blog. If you look there you'll see what I mean by redundancy - we already have descriptions of the blogs, and full instructions for contribution....</small>
