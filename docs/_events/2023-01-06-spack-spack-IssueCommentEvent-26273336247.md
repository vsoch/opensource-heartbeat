<small>For context - pakages is a thin wrapper to spack, and handles bundling up spack packages into OCI artifacts to push to a registry and pull down again to a build cache to install from. It handles other kinds of builds but that's the builder we use for the spack-updater actions. I would have contributed oras natively in spack so we could store spack archives in Github packages but it was too hairbally with the current aws build cache....</small>
