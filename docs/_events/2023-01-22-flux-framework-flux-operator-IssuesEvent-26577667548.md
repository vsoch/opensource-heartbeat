<p>Have automated deploy for the build config</p><small>Currently I run `make build-config` to update the flux-operator.yaml (to install it to a cluster) in examples/dist. However, this is error prone - I could forgot! So either we should have a check in the CI that the user has run it (and fail if the two files are different) or have a different deploy strategy....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator/issues/70' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
