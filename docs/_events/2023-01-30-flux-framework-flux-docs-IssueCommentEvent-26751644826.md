<small>This actually would work if we just had them generated in a running container, e.g., I do it with the flux-restful-api (although it's using python and interacting with flux via REST, see this tutorial: https://flux-framework.org/flux-restful-api/auto_examples/api_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-api-tutorial-py. That's possible with sphinx gallery which (typically) you run Python for - could you elaborate if you are just interested in running flux python examples or something else?...</small>
