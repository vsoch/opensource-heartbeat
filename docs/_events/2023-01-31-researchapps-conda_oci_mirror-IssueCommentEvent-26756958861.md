<small>okay I did a little more tweaking, I added support for a serial mode (for debugging) and also download the repodata.json on mirror every time, no matter what. I think we can further improve upon the push/pull functionality, but it's not high priority compared to mirror so it can wait. For testing, I think as soon as we can get that reliable set of testing packages to mirror (and then I update the tests here) we should be pretty good (and I can look at that other repodata file)....</small>
