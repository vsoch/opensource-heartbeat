<small>okay check out what I just added - I'm not sure I like my variable naming, but the (for now) `include_yanked` will use the repodata_from_packages.json instead for the mirror, while still ultimately uploading the repodata.json. https://github.com/researchapps/conda_oci_mirror/pull/2/commits/42696079a1d7a20ca591515546a74d69c51972a5. It's not exposed to the cli yet, but I suspect would /might be used within Python somewhere. Better naming suggestions appreciated!...</small>
