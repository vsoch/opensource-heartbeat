<small>This is looking great! I'm in the middle of a work day and won't be able to review until after (when you are sleeping!) but I'll definitely have time this evening or this weekend to take a closer look, test stuffs locally, etc. With your permission, I can update the PR with any changes or do a PR to your branch if that is preferred. Thanks for doing this fix! ...</small>
