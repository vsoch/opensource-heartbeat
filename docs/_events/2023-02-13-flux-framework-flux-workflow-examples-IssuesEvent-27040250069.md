<p>Meta issue for new examples</p><small>I'm going to be porting a lot of the subdirectories here to be sphinx gallery examples, and I'll make a list (and check them off) as I go just so I can keep track! When that's done I think this repository can be archived. Still setting things up locally - list coming soon!...</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-workflow-examples/issues/91' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
