<small>> To push some of these tutorials along into something that can merged, perhaps just a short list of bullets of "why I should care about this command" at the top of some of these tutorials will be enough. And maybe just add a word of caution that "advanced topic, many users may not need to use these" or something would suffice?...</small>
