<small>Thansk @songjiaxun ! So that is exactly the tutorial I was following. The reason I ask about a secret is that when I'm creating the PVC / PV in Go, I get an error if the secret field is empty. In other words, I'm not able to reproduce the example you provide from Go because it doesn't let me make the spec without the secret....</small>
