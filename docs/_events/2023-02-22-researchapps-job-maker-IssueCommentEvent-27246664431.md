<small>I'm not clear how you are generating a file that doesn't have debug but your config does? Can you give me the exact commands to reproduce what you are doing? We need to figure out what is going wrong so the partitions show up. The partition information is how every node is defined in terms of its resources (memory, etc.) so if a cluster doesn't have partitions technically all the nodes would be under a faux partition called "normal."...</small>
