<small>Sure! So the use case is wanting to generate an SDK alongside an operator, e.g., for me I wanted a Python SDK alongside the operator-sdk. I came to this repository and was looking for a guide to walk me through that process, akin to what I had to ultimately discover: https://vsoch.github.io/2023/operator-sdk-python-sdk/. I can't link a docs page because you largely don't have any - the only way I was able to figure this out was by reading change notes and code in other projects....</small>
