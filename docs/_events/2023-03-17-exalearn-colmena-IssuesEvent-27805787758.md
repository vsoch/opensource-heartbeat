<p>Potential issue between FluxExecutor and colmena</p><small>Hi there! We've been trying to run the example workflow from ExaWorks (modifying to use the FluxExecutor) and there seems to be a bug - reported in detail here: https://github.com/ExaWorks/molecular-design-parsl-demo/issues/2#issuecomment-1474295903 that it hangs. It would be nice to get this working to have full examples using the Flux Operator, and as suggested by @WardLT we might start with simple test cases (and use the FluxExecutor). Let me know how I can be of help....</small><a href='https://github.com/exalearn/colmena/issues/97' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
