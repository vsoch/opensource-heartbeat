<small>I think that was the main bottleneck - how slow it was to get everything setup and working. I think that early user interaction where everything is installed / loaded and discovered by the user is really important, because in ~5 minutes they are going to quickly decide if they like it (is it easy? intuitive?) or not (and then move elsewhere). The question I want to pose to you next is - what use cases are the strongest to tackle first, or in other words, who is the audience? As an example, if the audience is developers and these are for development environments, it would make sense to have a bunch of tutorials that show how that works for different (common) scenarios. If it's for reproducing a workflow, do the same but for workflows. I can definitely help more with this, although I'd definitely want the entire thing to be a bit speedier first, and then maybe we can write down a plan for what use cases should be tackled first....</small>
