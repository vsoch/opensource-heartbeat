<p>Usage in Kubernetes?</p><small>Hi!  Has anyone tried this in the context of Kubernetes? I could create a daemon set to install the needed deps for the nodes, and the main thing I think I'm not sure how to do is to ensure there are credentials there for doing the bind. Has anyone tried this / has experience and could make some suggestions? Thank you!...</small><a href='https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/issues/180' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
