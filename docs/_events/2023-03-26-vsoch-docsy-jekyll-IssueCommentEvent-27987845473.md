<small>The entire thing is just a website, so you'd need to edit the sidebar.html with your custom (likely) javascript, and css classes to control that. If I were doing it I'd take a look at how that site does it. A very simple way is to add identifiers to the top level and children, and then add an "on click" event for the parent that toggles the visibility of the children....</small>
