<small>okay success! I'll have an automated build with core serac and the provided examples deployed soon. I'd like to test it out in the Flux Operator so my next (and last question, don't worry!) is about workflows. Do you have any example projects that do something cool with serac with parameters we could potentially scale, or any kind of extra complexity or services?...</small>
