<small>@johanneskoester an option to get around this bind (and the permissions issues, which weirdly I haven't seen locally) would be to have a directive that allows the user to specify a snakemake workflow (in GitHub) to download to the operator - this would be done as a pre command. The con then is that the output wouldn't be saved to the filesystem. We probably need to think harder about the ideal execution modes because likely someone will want to run the workflow from GitHub, or some cloud storage mount....</small>
