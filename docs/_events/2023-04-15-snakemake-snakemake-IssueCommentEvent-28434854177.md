<small>@johanneskoester question for you - are there specific snakemake workflows that benchmark something (tools or similar?) that the larger bio-sciences community is interested in? I'm putting a plan for a paper for the flux operator and it would be interesting to run such a workflow to hit that target audience. Pinging @pditommaso in case he knows of similar ones for nextflow....</small>
