<small>Hi! Me again. I am again having weirdness with my account - I was able to upload OK https://asciinema.org/a/pF0bMz1uMO8ToqKRcpi7vJ0T3 but since the browser logged me out, I can't edit/ change the status. The click of the link to login seems to not be sending any email, so either my email was never changed from the old stanford one, or there is a bug / delay of some kind. Please help! I don't want to lose my account!...</small>
