<small>This would require building zeromq in the operator image and then using the bindings - I was using them through Flux but (in retrospect) I could try just using them on their own. I'll give this a try - I think I had attempted it last year but wasn't able to get it working (mostly just new to cgo) but given I have it working through Flux bindings, it's probably worth another try! That would totally solve the issue for good, so it's a great suggestion :+1: ...</small>
