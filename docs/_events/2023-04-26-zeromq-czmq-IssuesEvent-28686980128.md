<p>Saving certificate to memory?</p><small>Hi! I'm using zeromq from within a Kubernetes operator to generate a configmap to write / provide to pods. I noticed here: https://github.com/zeromq/czmq/blob/0b3a4c5e5c308b3d81ecb73fdf0030c150af3ed6/src/zcert.c#L18-L19 there is a note about saving to memory, and I was wondering if there is an example / test that shows how to do that? Ideally we would not need to save these paths to the filesystem of the operator. Thank you!...</small><a href='https://github.com/zeromq/czmq/issues/2263' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
