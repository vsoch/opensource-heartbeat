<small>Your best bet is to ask at https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory-experiments and you can see the folks that have worked on that experiment over the years: https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory-experiments/commits/master/two_stage_decision. I didn't make most of the experiments, just packaged them up, so I'm afraid I don't know the answer to questions about them....</small>
