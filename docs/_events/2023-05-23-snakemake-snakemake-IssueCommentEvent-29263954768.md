<small>Fantastic! Also - I've been doing work with elasticity in the operator (https://flux-framework.org/flux-operator/tutorials/elasticity.html and full story https://vsoch.github.io/2023/elasticity/) and I think this might be a better design for Snakemake. E.g., the implementation would be similar to as it is here, but instead of controlling creation / destruction of MiniClusters, it would request resizing. I've just started experiments with resizing Kubernetes too, although that is more vendor specific so likely would be harder to add here....</small>
