<small>To keep the discussion synced - the issue we are running into here is that the networking needs some work: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/discussions/7615#discussioncomment-6016189 I'm going to try out usernetes (which might be able to support custom CIDR) and then maybe we can integrate that with k3s....</small>
