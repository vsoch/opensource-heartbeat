<small>I would hugely discourage an approach that requires a re-pull - that's going to tax the registry / networking quite a bit. And the cache just is saving to the user's home (or your custom Singularity cache) so is there any reason you can't prepare a custom shared cache and have people use it? Another approach that I'll suggest (and disclaimer I am the developer) is singularity-hpc, which allows you to install containers as modules - meaning your user would just load the module and use it. https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-hpc...</small>
