<small>Third time is the charm! This build worked: https://github.com/flux-framework/spack/actions/runs/5140260118/jobs/9252606340. Here is the second one that failed too if it helps (so we have two fails, one working, all done without a cache). https://github.com/flux-framework/spack/actions/runs/5140260118/jobs/9252364258...</small>
