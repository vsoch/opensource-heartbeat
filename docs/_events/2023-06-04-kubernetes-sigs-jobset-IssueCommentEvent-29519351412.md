<small>But I don't think this uses anything with the headless service? I just turned it off, and the notebook still forwards. I think it would mostly be important if different things within a jobset (e.g., more than one pod) needed to communicate. For a one off pod serving something on a single port, we don't need JobSet / the extra DNS....</small>
