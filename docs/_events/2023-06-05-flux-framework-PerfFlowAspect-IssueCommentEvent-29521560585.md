<small>Yeah! It's fairly simple - you basically need VSCode, docker, and the extension. We have a small guide in the flux repository: https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/blob/master/vscode.md and let me know if you have specific questions (glad to help, and grateful for you trying to reproduce)!...</small>
