<small>A quick update - I've been trying to deploy a cluster that will connect for most of today, and I'm starting to wonder if my experiments with networking (which were on Compute Engine) have borked something. I would have to do manual cleanups of particular components, and maybe I removed something important? But either way, I'm not able to do any testing of anything on Kubernetes with the Flux Operator - it just never connects, nor do I see DNS ever working, and even for the smallest clusters. I likely need to open up a support ticket somewhere for this (unrelated to this issue) but wanted to post the update since I'm largely not empowered to do any more work debugging it (and unfortunately I have ideas of things to try :/) ...</small>
