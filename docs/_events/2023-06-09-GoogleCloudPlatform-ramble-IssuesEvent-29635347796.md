<p>Question: support for workflows outside of spack?</p><small>Hiya! Is there support (or planned support) for being able to define an execute workflows with other kinds of package managers? E.g., one very easy family would be something like conda/mamba to install a bunch of python machine learning libraries, which aren't handled as well under spack. Thanks!...</small><a href='https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ramble/issues/164' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
