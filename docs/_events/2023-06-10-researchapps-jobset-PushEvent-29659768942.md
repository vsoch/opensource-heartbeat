<small>update jobset operator/tests for network

Problem: The Network directive is now defined under the JobSet directly.
Solution: The operator code should handle the network on the level of
the JobSet, including the default Subdomain (JobSet.Name) and for
all previous tests that expected the replicated job name to be
included.
