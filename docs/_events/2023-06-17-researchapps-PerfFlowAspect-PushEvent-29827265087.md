<small>add developer container

Problem: it is hard to build this for use on a native solution
Solution: create a development container. We intiially targeted a VSCode
devcontainer, but ran into considerable issue that we have not figured out
yet! A good fall-back is to use a basic container that can be provided
via an automated build.
