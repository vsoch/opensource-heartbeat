<small>> You can do it in a way that is opaque to HQ, by just creating a task that will start MPI processes internally. This would work with the "main task streaming". But in this case you somehow need to also manage the other MPI nodes (if the MPI computation is distributed), and in that case it's arguable whether you even need HQ at all....</small>
