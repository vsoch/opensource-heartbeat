<small>okay - tested locally. Current main branch works for me, along with this one. If it was just this set of failures (and you haven't tried again) I would do that first, and maybe wait until later if there is some shared resource across the projects that is having a moment. If that doesn't resolve on its own we will need to do some more sanity checks - likely triggering a build we know has worked before first, and that will tell us if it's ephemeral / something about the testing setup....</small>
