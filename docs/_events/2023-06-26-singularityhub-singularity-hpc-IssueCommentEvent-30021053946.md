<small>@marcodelapierre I'm going to need a second pair of eyes on this one! Testing locally (albeit without module software) it all looks ok - the recipe I generate has the wrapperDir instead of the moduleDir, and it seems to be added to the path, and it corresponds with the wrapper I see written. I don't know why it doesn't find the executable in the test - I think likely there is a bug I'm not seeing....</small>
