<small>Hi folks! I maintain the flux operator and a few others that launch HPC schedulers as Kubernetes Jobs (Indexed and Jobset) and this caught my eye because we'd like to try launching, for example, a Job from our custom resource definition with AIrflow. I haven't looked at this carefully, but I did see that it is branded for spark, and wanted to step back and see if we might discuss a general implementation that could be a base class for (or just support) any number of custom resource definitions for kubernetes? Thanks!...</small>
