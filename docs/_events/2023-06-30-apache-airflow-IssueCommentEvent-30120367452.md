<small>> I won't be able to contribute any more than this, unfortunately. This PR also dragged on too long(passed the 1 year mark) and it is hard to keep track of the changes in the main branch since it goes out of date more often. better to merge this and somebody can always extend and come up with a generic implementation....</small>
