<small>This is working now and can be reviewed. I changed nothing, and I have no idea why it's working. I think it might be related to the aws metadata (describe-instances) that sets conditions for the efa / network devices. If it wasn't completed/ready on the first tries, maybe that could lead to this outcome?...</small>
