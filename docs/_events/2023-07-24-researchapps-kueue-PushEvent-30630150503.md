<small>add example MPI operator job

We determined that the issue with running the MPI Job example
was that the order of operations for installing Kueue and the
MPI Operator is important - the MPI operator must be installed
first! Once that is done, each of the YAML applied example and
the Python example worked. Here we are adding the Python example.
