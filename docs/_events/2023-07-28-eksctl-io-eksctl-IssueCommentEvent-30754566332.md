<small>@cPu1 and @Himangini this is still an issue and it's almost 7 months later - I've tested your suggestions and I've now opened two PRs https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl/pull/6302 and https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl/pull/6743 that fix this. The helm chart is not a solution because we are using the plugin yaml that is provided here. What is your plan to fix this in eksctl and what else can I do to help? ...</small>
