<small>Thank you again to you both! I almost have the debian setup done, although I'm not exactly a morning person (got up to chat with you!) so I'll probably go back to sleep for a bit and be in touch later today / this weekend, and of course this means we can chat more next week. Happy Friday and have an amazing weekend!...</small>
