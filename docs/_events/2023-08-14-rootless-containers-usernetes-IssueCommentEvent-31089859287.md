<small>Heyo! Wanted to ping for next week and see if anyone @aojea or @AkihiroSuda had thoughts about the above? What should we try next? If you don't have ideas I could take a shot at PR to try and generalize the scripts to not be hard coded for docker-compose (in case there is some tiny error in there leading to the behavior here). Happy Sunday!...</small>
