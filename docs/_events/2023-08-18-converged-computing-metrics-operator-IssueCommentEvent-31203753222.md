<small>Thank you! It was a collaboration between an AI image generator and I - I have a small GPU I run in my apartment for these purposes, mostly to make hilarious pictures of Jeff Bezos riding dinosaurs (but sometimes something useful)? This guy was a few variations, and then I brought him into Gimp for a lot of manual editing - the trick to making them look good is cleaning up all the edges, fixing some of the weird parts with custom painting, and basically doing that until you are satisfied. I use other programs / online tools to create the text. I think he came out adorable! ...</small>
