<p>Contribute to singularity.lang?</p><small>hey @karljohanw ! We are discussing highlighting for Singularity recipes in emacs and stumbled on your work here! https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity.lang/issues/11. The LICENSE is not open to being able to use it, but would you be interested in contributing to our set of syntax highlighters at https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity.lang or minimally just a link in our README? Thank you!...</small><a href='https://github.com/karljohanw/singularity-mode/issues/1' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
