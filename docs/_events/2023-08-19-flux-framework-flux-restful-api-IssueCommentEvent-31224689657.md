<small>hey @khoing0810 ! It looks like you are bringing in commits that were from previous work (and squashed). The way to fix this is to keep your fork main branch absolutely in sync with the one here, and always checkout fresh. Let me know if you want some help to look at this / walk through this process - most projects won't be happy to just ignore (e.g., squash and commit) and will want to see a logical git history, so we should make sure you know how to do that. Happy weekend!...</small>
