<p>Containerization?</p><small>Hiya! I have a possibly dumb question. I've built this into a Docker container (and it seems to work) and I'm wondering what interfaces are used to derive the metrics/data? E.g., I'm wondering if I run this in Kubernetes in a sidecar pod, if the metrics would reflect the entire node the pod is on (or just the pod in question). Thanks!...</small><a href='https://github.com/ovis-hpc/ovis/issues/1261' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
