<small>@marcodelapierre I won't have time this weekend (or maybe next) - I have to make and record a full talk, plus write a full paper (that I haven't started yet) in the next two weeks, plus a second talk and entire set of experiments (for late October) that also aren't started yet, on top of regular work, so I don't think I'll have time for my fun extra projects! But I'm adding to my calendar for after those are done....</small>
