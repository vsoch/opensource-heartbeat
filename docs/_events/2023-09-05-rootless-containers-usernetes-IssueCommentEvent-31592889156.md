<small>Possibly coming from here? https://github.com/rootless-containers/usernetes/blob/ee1f4ea766e8a3ed35161d5f80e01394f37efdb3/Makefile#L8 Although I'm not sure if this is just the hostname for the container. But if there is some interface with the host (and we need the actual host) that could be a bug....</small>
