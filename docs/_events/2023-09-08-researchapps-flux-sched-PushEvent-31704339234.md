<small>fix: devcontainer to use bookworm and install cmake

Problem: the current development environment (VSCode
Development Container) is not using the latest base (bookworm)
and is missing dependencies python3-yaml and an updated cmake
and ninja for building.
Solution: Update Dockerfile to use flux-core bookworm and add
missing dependencies!
