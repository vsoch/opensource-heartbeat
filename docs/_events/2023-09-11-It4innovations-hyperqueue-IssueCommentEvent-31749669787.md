<small>oh! I just remembered (right after I posted of course, lol). So we also needed JobSet for arm, but I haven't heard anything on that issue. https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset/issues/237. I think I was able to bring up the arm images but not actually get everything running. I'll ping them again now....</small>
