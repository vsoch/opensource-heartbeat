<small>Add/python parser generic (#60)

* preparing to run osu benchmarks experiments

we need to have a generic parser to allow for saving
the complete, raw logs. The parser is good, but we can
run it after - I would rather be conservative and get
the entire log vs have some bug with parsing and miss
something.
