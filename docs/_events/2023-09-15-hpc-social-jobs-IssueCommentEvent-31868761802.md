<small>hey @hadriandjohari ! I would suggest that you put the job id alongside the title, and then the link with the URL. The reason is because this is a fairly rare format and it would be cumbersome to add an extra field just for (what comes down to) a little extra description. The job would be unique from others that are similar due to that id. If you want to try that out, I can take a look after and see how it looks. Let me know if you have any questions, and thanks for the post!...</small>
