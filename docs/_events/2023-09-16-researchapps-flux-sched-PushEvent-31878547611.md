<small>reapi: updates for golang

Problem: Go bindings can be more friendly to Go developers
Solution: This includes docstring changes, the main module path
to be under flux-framework, returning Go error instead of int,
and updating tests to return nil (no error) instead of 0. The
module path is fixed from a development variant to a
flux-framework one. Finally, it fixes the Go bindings to
use a struct instead of passing around a ctx variable. Our
goal with these final changes to the Go module is to make
the code more friendly to future go developers.
