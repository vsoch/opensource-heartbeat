<small>Update: I am currently modeling these snippets within the executor. https://github.com/rse-ops/snakemake-executor-plugin-googlebatch/pull/2. This is because the design is specific to Batch, e.g., having different sub-steps (typically for setup, barrier, then run) so it would be hard to represent as a single snippet (traditional snakemake snippet). I'll keep this generic use case in mind in case we can still integrate here....</small>
