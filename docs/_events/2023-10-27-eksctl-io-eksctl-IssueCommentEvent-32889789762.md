<small>Thank you! :raised_hands: I'm about to go to bed, but please let me know what is needed for review. The other show stopper for us (meaning the functionality absolutely did not work given the bug) was https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl/pull/6870 and the daemonSet with runAsNonRoot to true. But likely we can compromise on that one and just use the helm template. But then arguably the efaEnabled should be removed here....</small>
