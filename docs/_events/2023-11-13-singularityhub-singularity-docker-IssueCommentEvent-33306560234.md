<small>@HippocampusGirl thank you for the suggestion! Not having a latest tag was an explicit decision to make the person think about their choice of version. In that it's a moving target, it would be dangerous for someone to pin "latest" into some pipeline and then later get a very different image. These are the current reasons we have not been providing latest....</small>
