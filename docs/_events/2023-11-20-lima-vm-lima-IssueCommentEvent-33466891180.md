<small>@afbjorklund how are you handling creating the join-command here (and sharing with a worker?) I'm trying to get that working for my setup, and it seems like the mounts are not done until the provision is done (so I can't write content there) and there doesn't seem to be a copy directive for into the build. I found limactl copy but that assumes both are running (and I'd like the second to provision with the file) https://fig.io/manual/limactl and I found this issue https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/issues/594 but it wasn't clear that there was a resolution. Thanks for the tips!...</small>
