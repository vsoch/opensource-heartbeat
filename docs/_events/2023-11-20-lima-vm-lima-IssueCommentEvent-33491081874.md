<small>Thanks for the help! I now have a worker and control plane set of configs, and it's entirely automated except for copying the join-command to the (TBA worker) directory that is mounted and available for provision, and then for actually running join I have the user do that interactively because otherwise there is an issue with containerd. But overall it's just a few commands and very easy, and that's great! Thanks for all the help! https://github.com/converged-computing/usernetes-lima...</small>
