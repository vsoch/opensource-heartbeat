<small>And my thinking so far from this discussion is that I'm not comfortable adding anything to the executor that requires enabling an extra service, and one that can accrue costs (albeit slowly) over time. It's not transparent enough, and it adds additional complexity for the user to setup (and need to request an increase in quota or other PubSub setup). I would rather direct the user to the console and then provide a helper script to get a particular log....</small>
