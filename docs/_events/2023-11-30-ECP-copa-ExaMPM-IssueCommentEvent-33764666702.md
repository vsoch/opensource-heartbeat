<small>This is probably my stopping point for working on it then - I'm not sure what the problem above is (and I'm still inexperienced with MPI). For context I was going to add it to the metrics operator https://github.com/converged-computing/metrics-operator and use for converged computing experiments on Kubernetes, but I'll skip over it and move on to the next. Thanks!...</small>
