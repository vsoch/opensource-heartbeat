<small>@tzneal can you show me an example of a launch template that updates the instances to use one thread per code (and i'm familiar with the snippets to do that)! I can figure out the logic to determine if the instance needs it, and I see that I can use it here:  https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/1.26.85/reference/services/eks/client/create_nodegroup.html. I should be able to test it soon and give you feedback....</small>
