<small>Second update: I tested this more today and think it's an improvement on the current. The spot API limits the unique requests I can make (e.g., changing zones) so I'm going to wait another day (or possibly two) to get another quota to do a full comparison between the two size groups. That should give me a ballpark estimate if (at least according to this algorithm) there is opportunity to continue with spot experiments. Either way, I'll add the resulting data to this PR and then merge....</small>
