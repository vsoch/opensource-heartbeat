<small>In case anyone is interested, I'm working on them here: https://github.com/converged-computing/jsongraph-go. We have a few projects in mind for these (so updates likely) but for the time being I'm keeping it very simple to just define structs for the different types of graphs supported in v2. Thanks!...</small>
