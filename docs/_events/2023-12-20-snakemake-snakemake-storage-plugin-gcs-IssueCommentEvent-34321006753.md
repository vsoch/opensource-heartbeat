<small>@johanneskoester if you have bandwidth, I am done with the intel MPI example but blocked here: https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-executor-plugin-googlebatch/issues/18. I think there might be a bug with this example that I got from snakemake (the output is generated but empty)....</small>
