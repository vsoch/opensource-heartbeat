<small>hey @FeynmanZhou ! I remember looking at the code when I opened the issue, and I think I could take a first shot but I need some guidance about the logic. I've had a hard time following it since the refactor from push/pull to the more abstract design now. If someone can provide that guidance I'm happy to take a shot, otherwise feel free to assign to someone familiar with the codebase. ...</small>
