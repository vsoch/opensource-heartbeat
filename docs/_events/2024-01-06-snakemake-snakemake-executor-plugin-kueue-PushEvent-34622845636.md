<small>feat: add support for flux operator (#6)

* wip: add support for flux operator
* prototype with flux operator working!

I have the MiniCluster created and the command running - the challenge now
will be figuring out how to hand the long snakemake command to flux to actually
run.

both hello world and lammps are working! We use the launcher approach,
which gives the user more freedom to submit jobs as they need/like.
