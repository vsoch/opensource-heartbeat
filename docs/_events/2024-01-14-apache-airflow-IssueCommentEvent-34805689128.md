<small>Going to agree with you @bolkedebruin. I had similar issues about 5 years ago, and while I think the intention is best, when it results in a PR being open on the order of years and not a more reasonable few months, it gives me pause. I can't comment on the details of the community here because it's been too long since I contributed, but it seems to me that something is off when the PR time is on the order of years. My heart goes out to you @potiuk, I hope you find the right balance, and seek feedback if/when you determine that things might not be working....</small>
