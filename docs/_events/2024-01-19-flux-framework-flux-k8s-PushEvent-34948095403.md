<small>support for skeleton grpc server and service/ingress for external client

This adds a prototype support for an extra helm flag that
dually enables adding an extra grpc set of endpoints, and then
the configs (ingress and service) necessary to expose them.
I next need to figure out how to interact with grpc from
a local client, likely built from the same codebase and grpc
spec. This is super cool!!
