<small>That's awesome! That last paragraph is literally the design of the metrics-operator - the idea was to use JobSet like legos, adding on whatever additional volumes / commands/ features are needed. And it worked pretty well, although I probably went a bit too deep in terms of wanting to play with an interface design. Please ping me if there is something fun to collaborate on....</small>
