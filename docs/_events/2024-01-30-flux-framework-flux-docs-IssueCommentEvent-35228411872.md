<small>Gotcha. So I think if we are working on docs here, we can assume many readers will come with some (even minor) knowledge of what fair share is. Either we will let them make assumptions about our derivative and scope, or (what I think might be best) is we call that out, and then very clearly define the two and explain the difference....</small>
