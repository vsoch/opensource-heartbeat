<small> @alculquicondor  if anything jumps out at you here, your insights would be appreciated. I've tried a few times now to get this running - I'm installing the latest and pairing with queue, and each time the launcher continually crashes and in about half a second so I don't have time to see what is going on. I assume I can't debug the worker if the launcher isn't working, so not sure how to debug this. I started with the vanilla example in the mpi operator repository and then moved to the [example](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-k8s/blob/canopie22-artifacts/canopie22-artifacts/lammps/lammps_mpijob.yaml) my team was using for canopie-22 (which was working) but no luck either way....</small>
