<small>Ah gotcha! If you want to make new additions or changes speeder, then I'd recommend changed files: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/changed-files. I use that for container matrices so I only build containers with updated Dockerfile. If you are concerned about existing links breaking (across many files) a dumb thing I do is to segment a list of things (e.g., paths) into equal lists based on matches hashes to calendar month days, then run for the day (a small subset) each night. https://github.com/vsoch/split-list-action. You probably don't want to be checking everything on every PR, every time!...</small>
