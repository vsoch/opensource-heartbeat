<p>Design document?</p><small>Hiya! I was interested to learn about state machines (and in the context of rust) and found your project. I usually read code to understand how things work, but I'm not great with rust and was wondering if you had any design diagrams or similar somewhere, and that could help me read the code. Thanks!...</small><a href='https://github.com/krator-rs/krator/issues/76' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
