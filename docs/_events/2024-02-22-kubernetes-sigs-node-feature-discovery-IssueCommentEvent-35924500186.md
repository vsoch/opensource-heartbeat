<small>Hi folks! To keep this discussion moving (and not block our projects) I made a prototype of a "source only" node-feature-discovery, here https://github.com/converged-computing/nfd-source and you can see the number of dependencies we could nix by way of it here https://github.com/compspec/compspec-go/pull/22/files and that includes not needing to bump up to 1.21. It would be great to continue discussion, and I'd be happy to prototype something here to test out! I'm not familiar with the code base but I pick things up fairly quickly so not worried about that....</small>
