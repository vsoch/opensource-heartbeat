<p>create compspec-spack</p><small>I'm thinking ahead - and I think it would be useful to have a compspec-spack extractor. I think I already have most of the code for this, actually, in our prototype spack experiment, and I just need to make the repository here that properly wraps it. The use cases for this would be _post_ build to describe software in a spack install. We would also want to think about the use case for pre-build - likely this would just be information about the environment needed....</small><a href='https://github.com/compspec/compspec/issues/21' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
