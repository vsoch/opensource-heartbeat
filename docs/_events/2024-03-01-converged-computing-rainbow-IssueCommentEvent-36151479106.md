<small>Small update - more detailed output for checking the attributes, and I added a recursive function call to recurse into the jobspec (which was not properly happening before). Go doesn't have the ability to do "while (for) there are objects in this array" because the length of the array is pre-determined. So this recursive approach is probably best....</small>
