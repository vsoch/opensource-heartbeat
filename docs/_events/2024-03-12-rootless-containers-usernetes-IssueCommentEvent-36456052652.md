<small>Wow time flies - thanks again for your help on this @AkihiroSuda ! I thought of it because I'm running this again, just on slightly larger / better infrastructure (network and scale wise). To return to our last correspondence, for those interested in the talk, it's [the Bare Metal Bros](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2590-kubernetes-and-hpc-bare-metal-bros/) and was really fun to do - we are hoping to extend this to a reproducible setup for others to use (actually I'm mostly done with that as of this week, just tidying it up for our own experiments). AWS uses the elastic fiber adapter, and getting that working with EFA and usernetes took some elbow grease!...</small>
