<small>These are fantastic! It may seem like a tiny thing, but I will definitely try them out. It's unfortunate there isn't more work of this type with Go. Understandably most folks like MPI for HPC, but I think Go has a lot of interesting scientific use cases (and especially for distributed). Anyway, I really appreciate your insights....</small>
