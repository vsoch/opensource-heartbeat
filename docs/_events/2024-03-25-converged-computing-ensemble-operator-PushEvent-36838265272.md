<small>feat: scaling for workload-demand algorithm

It is working! This is just really cool - I can launch a workload
(a matrix of jobs) and then watch it wait a few increments, and then
the cluster scales according to the rules that I set. I have not
yet implemented scaling down, but can do that next.
