<small>hey @sbinet I'm trying to bring life back to the project, and (if nothing but a learning exercise) it's been really fun so far! I was able to implement the [sampler-to-sink](https://github.com/converged-computing/gomq/tree/main/examples/sampler-to-sink) example, [here](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairMQ/tree/master/examples/req-rep) and I was wondering if I could ask for help with the [request reply](https://github.com/converged-computing/gomq/pull/1)? I'm following (what I perceive to be) the logic in the FairMQ example, but my message is never received by the server. If you might be able to take a look and give me some hints, I'm hoping to get this one working, then try the router/dealer pattern, and my ultimate goal is to have something that can send pair to pair messages between nodes (if that is possible). And apologies for my naivete - I'm new to developing with these. Thank you!...</small>
