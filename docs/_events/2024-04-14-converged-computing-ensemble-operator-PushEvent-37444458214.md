<small>wip: testing different orderings (#12)

* wip: testing different orderings

Problem: randomize is limited for ordering
Solution: change randomize "boolean" into an order variable
that can take several forms. We will want to test this to
see how order of jobs can impact an ensemble with autoscaling.
