<p>Question: suggestion for storing state?</p><small>Hi! I'm new to using Memgraph, and am going to test it for a graph database backend for our resource manager and scheduler. I'm wondering how memgraph (if it can) represent state? For example, the basic graph is resources (nodes) and relationships between them (a node has some number of cores) and then the state would be whether some subset of those cores are allocated (being used) or not. So typically when we have a scheduling problem we consider these states to determine if a request for work can be matched (to free resources). Any suggestions / pointers would be appreciated, thank you!...</small><a href='https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/issues/1975' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
