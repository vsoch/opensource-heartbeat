<small>Thanks! So if I understand correctly, I'd need to have everything represented in key values pairs associated with nodes. For example, if a physical node resource is scheduled, it might have scheduled=true, or (because that is too simple for a need to find a time into the future) more likely, a timestamp when the node will next be free that increases as it is scheduled. ...</small>
