<small>@milroy I went through and changed most of the short variables (e.g., pgMgr) to be fully written out. I left a few that are convention for operators (reconcilers) like "mgr" (manager) and "req" (request). The one I didn't change from the original code was "ps" primarily because I don't know what that means. Let me know if there are others you'd like expanded. Thanks for starting to take a look!...</small>
