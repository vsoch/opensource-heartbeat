<small>`-B` is a bind request (the other form of that flag is `--bind`). and those commands show binding the environment file from the wrapper directory to the shpc environment. That isn't the actual command, because the actual command has a full path to that. If you do an exec you do need to provide a command. if you use shell you should shell in, and run will hit the container entrypoint....</small>
