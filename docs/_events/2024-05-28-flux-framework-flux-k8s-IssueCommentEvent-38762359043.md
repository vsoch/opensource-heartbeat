<small>@cmisale and @milroy - the changes here will tweak the Flux JGF a tiny bit so each has a containment path with (I think) correct indices. There are of course could be bugs, so I'd like to look it over together (and myself again). I tried my best to keep the commits scoped, but in practice there is one large one and a few smaller ones. I will hopefully get better at this....</small>
