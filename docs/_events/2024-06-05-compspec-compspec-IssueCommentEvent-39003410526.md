<small>This issue is deprecated - the proposals are moving forward but (the extent to which we can follow them exactly) is not clear to me. Arguably, we are going to be making our own jobspec nextgen format for compatiility, and then use JGF, so I'm not sure any of this applies directly. Going to close for now until I rethink it....</small>
