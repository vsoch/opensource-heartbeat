<small>Add depends on (#17)

* feat: support for depends_on

This adds working support for depends on, which
relies on adding a frobnicator plugin to support
a dependency creation based on the job name. I am
adding a full example directory and jobspec that works
with the VSCode developer environment where I have
"installed" the plugin.
