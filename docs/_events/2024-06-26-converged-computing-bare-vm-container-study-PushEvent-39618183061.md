<small>LAMMPS runs for 32 iterations on singularity vs bare metal (#1)

* first round of results!
* add lists of kernel functions
* add ebpf dockerfile
* ebpf: add automation to determine functions of interest
* add gromacs mpi

This includes a lima vm, along with a simple
set of steps to generate all the functions and run
the script against it (and time the whole thing).
This is not perfect but it is simple enough to
understand and use, and we can use it for our
further experiments!
