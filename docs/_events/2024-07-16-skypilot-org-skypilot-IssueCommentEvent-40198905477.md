<small>@romilbhardwaj gotcha - so would the assumption be that Flux is already running somewhere, and then skypilot would submit jobs to it? Would sky pilot also be deploying the flux cluster? And if so - what methods are typically done to do that (we have been using a combination of operators, cloud SDKs, and Terraform). For some of those we require custom base image builds (which we have private which would need to be made public)....</small>
