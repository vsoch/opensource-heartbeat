<small>ci: fix build ci to populate build-images.sh script

Problem: The upstream "hack/build-images.sh" has had most variables
for the environment removed in favor of an upstream Makefile, which
we do not currently use in our custom build.
Solution: define these variables in our Makefile equivalently.
