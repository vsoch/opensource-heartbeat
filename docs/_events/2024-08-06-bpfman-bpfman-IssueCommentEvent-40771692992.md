<small>hey @anfredette ! I wound up stepping back and I'm writing little eBPF programs on a VM to monitor containers - I am planning to start that way and then move to Kubernetes. Feel free to close the issue if you like - I'll get back to this but not for some time. I can always open a new one....</small>
