<small>group: first fully working group through cleanup    (#16)

* group: first fully working group through cleanup

This changeset adds the first completely working submit through
cleanup, where all tables are properly cleaned up! We can actually
see the group of pods run and go away. Next I want to add back
the kubectl command so we can get an idea of job state in the queue,
etc.
