<small>azure aks for cpu: first test runs are done

Most things are working except for mixbench (segfaults) and mt-gemm needs
an update to the script (and container rebuilds) because the metric
output is meaningless. AMG also needs a decision on the final params
since it is different from the rest - using amg from 2013 instead of
from 2023 (amg2023).
