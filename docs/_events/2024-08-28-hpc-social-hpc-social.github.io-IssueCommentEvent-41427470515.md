<small>We don't have current support for parsing RSS (but someone could jump on it). For the time being you can open a pull request and update the page content here https://github.com/hpc-social/hpc-social.github.io/blob/main/_projects/podcasts.md. I'd suggest providing links to the most common podcast venues (spotify, apple) and let people click to get the latest episodes....</small>
