<small>Docs/Windows: Clarify supported shells and caveats (#46381)

While the existing getting started guide does in fact reference the
powershell support, it's a footnote and easily missed. This PR adds
explicit, upfront mentions of the powershell support. Additionally
this PR adds notes about some of the issues with certain components
of the spec syntax when using CMD.</small>
