<small>All set! https://github.com/expfactory-experiments/space_adventure_pd. You can take a look at the other respositories to get a sense of the organization. In summary - most of the experiment files you are adding here should go there, and then only the metadata is added in this PR. Ping me in an issue there if you have questions. And please expect my responses to not be immediate - I'm on travel until early October....</small>
