<p>Creat experiment generation module</p><small>I'd like to be able to use gridtest to generate a matrix of parameters. E.g., I want to run many applications across problem sizes for a cloud, so I'd like to define that in a file and then populate templates with jinja. It's a fairly simple thing, and should be easy to do here....</small><a href='https://github.com/vsoch/gridtest/issues/42' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
