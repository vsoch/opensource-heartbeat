<small>I've been burned by that for two other projects this week! I don't have any ideas either, so I'll give that a shot. The ubuntu images are definitely latest so we are getting a newer Python. I can't reproduce the error locally so having trouble debugging. I'll try installing setuptools and report back....</small>
