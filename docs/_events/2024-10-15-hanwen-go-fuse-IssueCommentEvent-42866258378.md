<small>Thank you @hanwen ! I think there was something wrong with my environment - I restarted and was able to run the command. Now what happens is that I get a permission denied (even though the context is my PWD) and when I remove the read only, it freezes and I need to manually unmount. I'm wondering now (haven't tested yet) if the issue was placing the PWD at the mount root (where I wouldn't be allowed to run a command, even if it requites write)? I'm out and AFK and I can test things when I get back, if you have suggestions or an example to point to!...</small>
