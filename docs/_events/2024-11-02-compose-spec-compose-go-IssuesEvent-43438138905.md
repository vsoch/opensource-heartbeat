<p>Example to read config file from string?</p><small>This is likely a more rare use case, but I want to use go embed to include a string-ified compose file (that loads into a Project) and I'm wondering if you have an example to do that? I'm looking here: https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-go/blob/b9d3b1deec9bc25de0fa81867ca4df75aef5c791/cli/options.go and I see that ReadConfigFiles can accept a path or stdin, but not a loaded string. I can try to dig deeper and see if I can come up with something, or fall back to reading from file for now, but I'm hoping someone has come up with something. Thanks!...</small><a href='https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-go/issues/707' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
