<small>Both of these are done - the [slimmer](https://github.com/converged-computing/lammps-time/blob/5688beda479a9c6638eac29c95c3d87b591bc1cd/experiments/slim/compare-sizes.py#L102-L106) resulted in a lammps container 5.86x smaller, and the [kind experiment](https://github.com/converged-computing/lammps-time/tree/main/experiments/local-kind) generated similar results, but with a few added libraries (flux) and the model still seemed to perform well....</small>
