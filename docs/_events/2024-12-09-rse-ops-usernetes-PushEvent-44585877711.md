<small>feat: customization of exposed service ports

Problem: when deploying usernetes in a multi
tenant environment, there will likely be clashing
of ports due to their hard coding of traditional
values.
Solution: expose these ports (those mapped to the
host in the docker-compose.yaml and kubeadm-config
yaml as environment variables to customize.
