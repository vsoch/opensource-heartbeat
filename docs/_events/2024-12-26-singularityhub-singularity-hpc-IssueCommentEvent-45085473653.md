<small>@Amjadhpc that is a very reasonable feature request! Are you able to develop in Python or would you need help? You'd want to add a setting to settings.yaml that is something akin to `version_naming` and then a boolean that defaults to false (to preserve current behavior) and if true, you'd want to tweak the install path to instead of creating a directory with the version, to have it write a file with the module extension to that path instead. Let me know if you would like to give that a try and open a PR. Happy Holidays!...</small>
