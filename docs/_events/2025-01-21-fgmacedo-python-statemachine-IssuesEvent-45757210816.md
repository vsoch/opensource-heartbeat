<p>Question: example with dynamically defined states?</p><small>Hi! I stumbled on your library today, and it's exactly what I'm looking for to drive a series of jobs in a workflow that will be run in Kubernetes. For most of the examples, it looks like the `State` and relationships need to be defined in advance (and added as class attributes) and I'm wondering if you could point me to an example where this is done dynamically? E.g., ideally I could either define the class in a function (and return it) or somehow add the objects dynamically to the base `StateMachine`.  I started looking at that class and seeing if I could figure out how to do it, but this seems like it would be a common want so I wanted to ask here first. Thanks!...</small><a href='https://github.com/fgmacedo/python-statemachine/issues/518' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
