<p>Singularity as executable provider</p><small>Hi @douglasjacobsen! It looks like Singularity is hiding in ramble as (what I'm guessing is) a spack containerize output? I'm wondering if we might consider having a container provider that knows how to provision a container. E.g., right now I'm going to provide a container binary directly to internals->custom executables, but I wonder if there would be an easy way to define a URI alongside the config, and then have ramble check for Singularity and do the pull of the binary (just to the Singularity cache would be fine) if it doesn't exist....</small><a href='https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ramble/issues/863' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
