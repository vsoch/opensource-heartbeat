<small>test: improve testing setup for match and cancel

Problem: the current testing is not standard for Go,
and makes it hard to understand or run in units.
Solution: move testing into proper test alongside
package, and break apart testing for cancel and match.
Additionally, we are using the same graphs / jobspecs
from flux-sched.
