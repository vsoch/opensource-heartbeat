<small>I'm also wondering if we can support a generic application executor. For example, I don't need to hard code every specific argument for some application, I could just define a container, an input line with parameters, and then use ramble to programatically (and easily) run a lot of experiments without having to write an application.py for each. It's a more flexible approach that is less prone to not having, for example, an updated download of data, and it would allow for using ramble to reproduce experiments without needing to write a lot of those complex files. What do you think?...</small>
