<small>It should be OK to run locally - the Google sheet that is used for the update is grabbed progammatically via a csv url from Google sheets. What you might want to do is make a copy of the current `_data/jobs.yaml` in case you want to restore or redo tests. Although the script (if I remember) will generate a previous jobs file in the same directory. The update will write to tmp and then use that file to replace the current jobs, so it will update....</small>
