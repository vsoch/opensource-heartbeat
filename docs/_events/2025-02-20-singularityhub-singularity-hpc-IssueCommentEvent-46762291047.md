<small>shpc does not use rpds directly (and I'm not sure what it is). From the trace it looks like it's required for jsonschema, so perhaps there was an update to that library that triggered this? I think the bug report would go there, and we might just pin jsonschema to a previously working version in the meantime (while it isn't fixed)....</small>
