<small>@Oil3 did you ever test this on more than one GPU or node? I ran the benchmark today on one node, one GPU and only one test didn't run (a verison of keras too new) and I'm wondering if it can extend beyond that. From a quick glance it seems like maybe it would work on >1 GPU but not more than one node?...</small>
