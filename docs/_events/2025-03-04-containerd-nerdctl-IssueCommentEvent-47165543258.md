<small>+1, this would be useful for me as well. I'm having a hard time with podman on our HPC clusters, and the underlying issue is the uid mappings (and how many there are in the rootless kind container, there would be no reasonable way to give those kinds of ranges to each user). But I think I could map specific ones to the user on the system but need this exposed. I was trying nerdctl and it failed with not being able to extract layers because of permissions....</small>
