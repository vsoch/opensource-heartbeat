<small>I can comment that having built flux-sched and flux-core in a ton of environments, I either have needed to pin flux-sched to (at most) 0.37.0 and then flux-core to ~ 0.68.0, _or_ use newer gcc and build the latest for both. Flux core seems pretty flexible to build with different versions of flux-sched - the breaks always happen with gcc/clang versions and sched....</small>
