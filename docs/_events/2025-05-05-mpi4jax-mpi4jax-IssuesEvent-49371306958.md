<p>Examples for multi-node scaling study?</p><small>Hi! Would your water example be suitable (or others you have) for a strong or weak scaling study? We are doing a study on 4 to 64 nodes and looking for apps / proxy apps / benchmarks / synthetic benchmarks that could be candidates. The only requirement is that I can build it into a container and run it across nodes, and there is some kind of figure of merit (FOM) at least running time. Thanks!...</small><a href='https://github.com/mpi4jax/mpi4jax/issues/280' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
