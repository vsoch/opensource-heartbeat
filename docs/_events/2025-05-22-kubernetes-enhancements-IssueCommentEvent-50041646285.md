<small>> Would anyone be interested in pursuing the possibility of having filter extension point to take a group of pods and a group of nodes and perform the searching for the combination of nodes for a list of pods at once? The current filter extension point is not built for this. Yet, some plugins might be extended this way and if a proper implementation is provided this might be a path forward. Has anyone already concluded this is no-go? Or, this path has not been explored in more detail due to its complexity?...</small>
