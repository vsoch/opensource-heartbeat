<small>> I'd like to see an example of this at work, i.e spin up a pod with a resource request and see that the RDMA device gets properly mounted to the pod. Since a lot of that logic depends on NIC devices there may need to be some work done there for proper allocation/release of the device from the host to the pod....</small>
