<small>@michaelasp I have an equivalent example started - but I have a catch22. The environment I'm working in is user space kubernetes. We can't see any devices without a privileged pod. When we add that, we see everything. This means the selector is irrelevant. I need an environment with production Kubernetes that I can run without rootless. I had Google Cloud credits but they expired, and I'd need to pay out of pocket. @aojea can you help? It shouldn't be too many to test this out. Once I have that, I can add the full analogous example to the docs....</small>
