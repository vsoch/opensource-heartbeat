<p>Good example for scaling study?</p><small>Hi mfem! We are doing a scaling study (4 to 64 nodes) and looking for contender apps/ proxy apps/ benchmarks/ synthetic benchmarks. Is there one that mfem has, with some Figure of Merit, that you would recommend? Strong or weak scaling would work, and the only requirement is that I can build it into a container and run it across nodes. Thanks!...</small><a href='https://github.com/mfem/mfem/issues/4848' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
