<small>@aojea that is good thinking. I am not sure I can give direct access to the cluster, but if we did a hackathon I could drive whatever orchestration that @gauravkghildiyal needs. I am in Pacific time now - could you give me the window of hours / days that would work for the meeting (August 6th or after)? I will want to test the AKS setup first and spec our the costs....</small>
