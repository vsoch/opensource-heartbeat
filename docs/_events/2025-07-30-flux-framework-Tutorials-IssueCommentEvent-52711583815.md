<small>@wihobbs the reason I'm doing it now is because I consider that a sunk cost. We can't ensure those links (somewhere on the internet) will be persistent, but I think a user would navigate to the root of the repository and realize the structure is changed. I want to change it sooner than later so moving forward into the future (when we have more links, more people that remember them) they conform to a better structure. And in some cases, if a person _tells_ us about an old link, we can post an update in the place they informed us had the incorrect one (generally speaking, this would be other README.md or links in YouTube videos)....</small>
