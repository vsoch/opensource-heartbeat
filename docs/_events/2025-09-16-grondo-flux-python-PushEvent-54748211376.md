<small>Expand info_commands in setup.py

Expanding our list of info commands to include those needed for the ticket. The only command provided that won't work is a blank python setup.py. If they use a source distributed that hasn't had the version changed from develop, there will also be a warning. The rest of the info output looks good.</small>
