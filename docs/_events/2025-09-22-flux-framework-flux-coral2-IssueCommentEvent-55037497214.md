<small>@mcfadden8 depending on when the demo is, I'm not sure we have a reasonable amount of time to consider filesystems for the demo - a run of LAMMPS that is triggered by the submission of a job is what we had scoped it to. Let us know more details of what you had in mind so we can discuss....</small>
